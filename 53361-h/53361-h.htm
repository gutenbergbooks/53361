<h2 id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I<br />
<span class="smaller">TIME TO GO WAYFARING AGAIN</span></h2>

<p>“Oh, dear!” loudly sighed Patsy Carroll.</p>

<p>The regretful exclamation was accompanied
by the energetic banging
of Patsy’s French grammar upon the table.</p>

<p>“Stay there, tiresome old thing!” she emphasized.
“I’ve had enough of you for one evening.”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, Patsy?”</p>

<p>Beatrice Forbes raised mildly inquiring eyes
from the theme she was industriously engaged in
writing.</p>

<p>“Lots of things. I hate French verbs. The
crazy old irregular ones most of all. They start
out one thing and by the time you get to the future
tense they’re something entirely different.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>“Is that all?” smiled Beatrice. “You ought to
be used to them by this time.”</p>

<p>“That’s only one of my troubles,” frowned
Patsy. “There are others a great deal worse.
One of them is this Easter vacation business. I
thought we’d surely have three weeks. It’s always
been so at Yardley until this year. Two
weeks is no vacation worth mentioning.”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s plenty of time to go home in and
stay at home and see the folks for a while, isn’t
it?” asked Beatrice.</p>

<p>“But we didn’t intend going <em>home</em>,” protested
Patsy.</p>

<p>“Didn’t intend going home?” repeated Beatrice
wonderingly. “<em>What</em> are you talking about,
Patsy Carroll? <em>I</em> certainly expect to go home for
Easter.”</p>

<p>“You only think you do,” Patsy assured, her
troubled face relaxing into a mischievous grin.
“Maybe you will, though. I don’t know. It depends
upon what kind of scheme my gigantic
brain can think up.</p>

<p>“It’s like this, Bee,” she continued, noting her
friend’s expression of mystification. “Father
and I made a peach of a plan. Excuse my slang,
but ‘peach of a plan’ just expresses it. Well,
when I was at home over Christmas, Father<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
promised me that the Wayfarers should join him
and Aunt Martha at Palm Beach for the Easter
vacation. He bought some land down in Florida
last fall. Orange groves and all that, you know.
This land isn’t so very far from Palm Beach.
He was going down there right after Christmas,
but a lot of business prevented him from going.
He’s down there now, though, and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You’ve been keeping all this a dead secret
from your little chums,” finished Beatrice with
pretended reproach.</p>

<p>“Of course I have,” calmly asserted Patsy.
“That was to be part of the fun. I meant to
spring a fine surprise on you girls. Your mother
knows all about it. So does Mrs. Perry. I went
around and asked them if you and Mab and Nellie
could go while I was at home during the
Christmas holidays. Aunt Martha liked my plan,
too. Now we’ll have to give it up and go somewhere
nearer home. We’d hardly get settled at
Palm Beach when we’d have to come right home
again. One more week’s vacation would make a
lot of difference. And we can’t have it! It’s
simply too mean for anything!”</p>

<p>“It would be wonderful to go to Palm Beach,”
mused Beatrice. “It would be to me, anyway.
You know I’ve never traveled as you have, Patsy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
Going to the Adirondacks last summer was my
first real trip away from home. Going to Florida
would seem like going to fairy land.”</p>

<p>Readers of “<span class="smcap">Patsy Carroll at Wilderness
Lodge</span>,” are already well acquainted, not only
with Patsy Carroll and Beatrice Forbes, but
also with their chums, Mabel and Eleanor Perry.
In this story was narrated the adventures of the
four young girls, who, chaperoned by Patsy’s
stately aunt, Miss Martha Carroll, spent a summer
together in the Adirondacks.</p>

<p>Wilderness Lodge, the luxurious “camp”
leased by Mr. Carroll for the summer, had formerly
belonged to an eccentric old man, Ebeneezer
Wellington. Having died intestate the
previous spring, his property and money had
passed into the hands of Rupert Grandin, his
worthless nephew, leaving his foster-daughter,
Cecil Vane, penniless.</p>

<p>Hardly were the Wayfarers, as the four girls
had named themselves, established at the Lodge
when its owner decided, for reasons of his own,
to oust them from his property. A chance meeting
between Beatrice and Cecil Vane revealed
the knowledge that the latter had been defrauded
of her rights and was firm in the belief
that her late uncle had made a will in her favor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
which was tucked away in some corner of the
Lodge.</p>

<p>The long-continued hunt for the missing will
and the strange circumstances which attended the
finding of it furnished the Wayfarers with a new
kind of excitement, quite apart from other memorable
incidents and adventures which crowded
the summer.</p>

<p>In the end, Cecil came into her own, and the
Wayfarers returned to Morton, their home town,
to make ready to enter Yardley, a preparatory
school, in which Mabel, Eleanor and Patsy were
to put in another year of study before entering
college.</p>

<p>When Beatrice Forbes had joined the chums
on the eventful vacation in the mountains, she
had fully expected on her return to Morton to
become a teacher in one of the grade schools.
Fortune, however, had smiled kindly on her.
Her great-aunt, whom her mother had visited
that summer for the first time, had exhibited a
lively interest in the great-niece whom she had
never seen.</p>

<p>Learning from Mrs. Forbes, Beatrice’s longing
ambition to obtain a college education, she had
privately decided to accompany Beatrice’s mother
to the latter’s home when her visit was ended,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
and thus view her ambitious young relative at
close range.</p>

<p>This she had done. She had found Beatrice
quite up to her expectations. She had also met
Patsy Carroll and promptly fallen into the toils
of that most fascinating young person. Patsy
had privately advanced Beatrice’s cause to so
great an extent that it was not long until Beatrice
was making joyful preparations to accompany
Mabel, Eleanor and Patsy to Yardley, as a result
of her aunt’s generosity.</p>

<p>So it was that the congenial quartette of Wayfarers
had settled down together at Yardley for
a year of conscientious study. It now lacked but
ten days until the beginning of the Easter vacation
and, as usual, energetic Patsy was deeply
concerned in the problem of how to make the best
of only two weeks’ recreation when she had fondly
looked forward to three.</p>

<p>“It wouldn’t do us a bit of good to ask for an
extra week,” mourned Patsy. “Three girls I
know have tried it and been snubbed for their
pains. What we must do is to get together and
plan some sort of outing that won’t take us so far
away from here. Of course we can’t be sure of
anything unless Aunt Martha approves. She’ll
be disappointed about not going to Palm Beach.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
She just loves to travel around with the Wayfarers,
only she won’t say so right out. Come on,
Bee. Let’s go and see the girls. Now that the
great secret has all flattened out, like a punctured
tire on my good old car, I might as well tell Mab
and Nellie the sad tale.”</p>

<p>“You go, Patsy. I must finish this theme.”
Beatrice cast a guilty glance at the half-finished
work on the table. “I must hand it in at first
recitation to-morrow and it’s a long way from
being finished.”</p>

<p>“Oh, bother your theme! You can finish it
later. It’s only eight o’clock. We’ll stay just a
few minutes.”</p>

<p>“Hello, Perry children!” greeted Patsy, when
five minutes afterward she and Beatrice broke in
upon their chums, who roomed on the floor above
Patsy and Beatrice.</p>

<p>“Hello, yourself,” amiably responded Mabel,
as she ushered them into the room. “Of course
you can’t read or you would have seen the ‘Busy’
sign on the door.”</p>

<p>“Pleasure before business,” retorted Patsy.
“Kindly ask us to sit down, but not on your bed.
I want a chair with a back to it. It’s strictly
necessary to my comfort.”</p>

<p>“Help yourself.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>This from Eleanor who had laid aside her book
and come forward.</p>

<p>“What’s on your mind, Patsy?” asked Mabel
curiously. “Something’s happened. I can tell
that by the way you look.”</p>

<p>“I have a heavy load on my mind,” declared
Patsy with deep impressiveness.</p>

<p>Dramatically striking her forehead, she cried,
“Ouch! That hurt!” giggled and dropped down
into a nearby chair.</p>

<p>“You almost knocked it off,” chuckled Beatrice,
seating herself on the edge of Mabel’s bed.
“The load, I mean.”</p>

<p>“I did not. I almost knocked my forehead off.
The load is still there. Now to get rid of it.”</p>

<p>Whereupon Patsy plunged into the subject
of the great secret.</p>

<p>“And Mother said we could go?” asked Eleanor
eagerly when Patsy had finished speaking.</p>

<p>“Certainly, but the powers that be, here at
Yardley, say you can’t,” reminded Patsy.
“Palm Beach is not for us this Easter. I’m so
disgusted over this vacation business!”</p>

<p>“It’s a shame!” exclaimed Mabel. “I don’t
want to go any place else. Why can’t we go
there, anyway? It would take us two or three
days to go and the same length of time to come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
back. We’d have a week there. That would be
better than nothing.”</p>

<p>“I suppose it would,” concurred Patsy rather
reluctantly. “It’s only that I hate being torn
up by the roots and hustled back here just the
very minute I’m getting used to things at the
Beach. There is so much to see there. Besides,
I’m simply crazy to go to the Everglades.
Father promised that he’d hire a real Indian
guide, to take us there on an expedition.”</p>

<p>“Let’s write to our people and tell them to
write to the registrar, asking if we can’t have that
extra week,” proposed Eleanor eagerly. “If
your Aunt Martha, our mother and Bee’s mother
would all write to her, it might do some good.”</p>

<p>“We can try it. I doubt whether it will help
much,” Patsy said gloomily. “Miss Osgood is
so awfully strict, you know. It’s our only
chance and a slim one. I’m going straight to my
room and write to Aunt Martha. Bee can write
to her mother as soon as she finishes a theme she’s
toiling over. You’d better write to-night, too.
The sooner we find out the best or the worst, the
sooner we’ll knew what to do about Easter. If
we can only have two weeks, Aunt Martha may
want to do the Beach anyway. If she doesn’t&mdash;well,
we’ll have to think up some place nearer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
Yardley to go to. I’m determined to have some
kind of trip, if it’s only to Old Point Comfort.
The Wayfarers have been cooped up all winter.
It’s time they went wayfaring again.”</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II<br />
<span class="smaller">A HARD-HEARTED REGISTRAR</span></h2>

<p>“If I were a registrar, I’d not be so horrid
as Miss Osgood,” wrathfully exclaimed
Patsy Carroll.</p>

<p>Four days had passed since the Wayfarers had
despatched their letters to their home allies. The
quartette were emerging from Yardley Hall as
Patsy flung forth her disgruntled opinion of Miss
Osgood.</p>

<p>They had been summoned to the registrar’s
office after classes that afternoon, there to be
stiffly informed by Miss Osgood that she saw no
convincing reason for granting them the privilege
of an extra week’s vacation.</p>

<p>“You wish this extra week merely on account
of a pleasure trip you have planned,” she had
coldly pointed out. “I have been besieged by a
dozen others with similar requests, none of which
I have granted. I have replied to the letters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
which I have received from Miss Carroll, Mrs.
Forbes and Mrs. Perry, stating that it is impossible
to make any exception in favor of you girls.
I sent for you to come here merely to impress
upon you that I shall expect you to return to
Yardley, from your Easter vacation, <em>on time</em>.
Any delay on your part will constitute a direct
defiance of my wishes. Kindly remember this
and govern yourselves accordingly.”</p>

<p>Such was the chilly ultimatum that had aroused
Patsy’s ire.</p>

<p>“It’s too mean for anything,” she sputtered,
as the four started across the campus. “Aunt
Martha says in the letter I received from her this
morning that unless we can have the extra week’s
vacation it’s not worth while making the trip to
Palm Beach. We can’t have it, so that settles
our grand Florida expedition. If we could go
down there in summer it wouldn’t matter so much
about losing this trip. But we can’t. It’s too
hot down there in summer time for comfort.
We’ll never have a chance to go there until we
are graduated from college. We’ll be old ladies
then and have to go around in wheel chairs,” she
ended ruefully.</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s only four years off. We may still
be able to totter about with canes,” giggled Eleanor.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
“Of course, we’ll have snow-white hair and
wrinkles, but then, never mind. We can sit and
do embroidery or tatting and talk of the happy
past when we were young and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Stop making fun of me, Nellie,” ordered
Patsy severely. Nevertheless she echoed Eleanor’s
giggle.</p>

<p>“Let’s hustle for the dormitory,” suggested
practical Beatrice. “This wind is altogether too
frisky to suit me. I’ve had to hang onto my hat
every second since we left the Hall.”</p>

<p>“It’s blowing harder every minute,” panted
Mabel, as a fresh gust swept whistling across the
campus, caught the four girls and roughly endeavored
to jerk them off their feet.</p>

<p>“It’s going to snow, I guess. It’s too cold for
rain,” remarked Patsy, squinting up at the sky.
“Easter comes awfully early this year, doesn’t it?
I can’t remember when it’s ever before been in
March. That’s another reason why it would be
fine to spend it at Palm Beach. The weather
there would be perfect.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, what’s the use in thinking about it,”
said Eleanor. “We might as well make the best
of things and plan something else.”</p>

<p>“I’m going to write to Auntie the minute I get
to my room,” announced Patsy, “and ask her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
where she thinks it would be nice for us to go for
Easter. I’d like it to be near the ocean, though;
Old Point Comfort, Cape May, Atlantic City, or
some beach resort.”</p>

<p>“I hate to give up the Palm Beach plan. Still,
wherever we go, well be together,” reminded
Mabel. “You can’t down a strong combination
like the Wayfarers.”</p>

<p>It being but a short walk from Yardley Hall
to the large dormitory where the students of
Yardley lived, the four girls were soon running
up the broad stone steps, glad to reach shelter
from the wind’s ungentle tactics.</p>

<p>As a preparatory school, Yardley was famed
for its excellence. It registered, however, but a
limited number of pupils. These lived in one
large dormitory, there being no campus houses
for their accommodation.</p>

<p>Yardley had been at one time a select boarding
school for girls. Later it had become a preparatory
school to college, and had earned the
reputation of being one of the best of its kind.</p>

<p>As the high school course which the Wayfarers
had completed was not sufficiently advanced to
carry them into college without additional preparation,
they had, after much discussion, chosen to
enter Yardley. A year of study there would fit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
them for entrance into any college which they
might select as their Alma Mater.</p>

<p>The fact that Yardley occupied a somewhat
isolated position of its own, the nearest town,
Alden, being five miles away, did not trouble the
Wayfarers. Being true Nature lovers they were
never at a loss for amusement during their
leisure hours. They found far greater pleasure
in tramping the steep hills which rose behind
Yardley than making decorous little trips to
Alden in Patsy’s car.</p>

<p>Though friendly with their classmates, the
Wayfarers nevertheless hung together loyally.
They were, as Patsy often declared, “a close corporation”
and quite sufficient unto themselves.</p>

<p>As the little band entered the dormitory that
blustering afternoon, they were feeling keenly
the disappointment so recently meted out to
them. It was decidedly hard to put away the
rosy visions of Palm Beach that each girl had
conjured up in her own mind.</p>

<p>“Come on up to our room, girls, and we’ll make
chocolate,” proposed Patsy. “It will probably
take away our appetites for dinner, but who
cares? I don’t believe I’d have much appetite,
anyhow. I’m all upset about this vacation business.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>Seated about the writing table which Patsy
had cleared for the occasion, the Wayfarers were
presently sipping hot chocolate and devouring
sweet crackers to the accompaniment of a mournful
discussion of the situation.</p>

<p>As a result none of them had any enthusiasm
for either dinner or study that evening. Dinner
over they gathered once more in Patsy’s room,
still too full of their recent disappointment to
banish it from conversation.</p>

<p>“We can’t make a single plan until we know
what Aunt Martha wants to do,” asserted Patsy
with a sigh. “Oh, I forgot to write to her before
dinner! I must do it now. Excuse me, Perry
children. Bee will amuse you. Bee, entertain
the young ladies. I’m going to be busy for a
little while.”</p>

<p>“We must go,” declared Eleanor, rising. “It’s
half-past eight. I really ought to study a little
bit. Mab, you’ve a whole page in Spanish to
translate. You’d better come along.”</p>

<p>“All right. Just listen to the wind!” Mabel
held up her hand. “How it shrieks and whistles
and wails! The banshees are out, sailing around
in the air to-night, I imagine.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad we’re not out, sailing around the
campus,” commented Beatrice. “We’d certainly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
sail. We couldn’t keep our feet on the ground.
We’d be blown about like leaves.”</p>

<p>“I think I’d like to go out and fight with the
wind,” announced valiant Patsy. “As soon as I
write my letter I’m going to take it out to the
mail box.”</p>

<p>“Good-bye, then. I may never see you again,”
laughed Eleanor, her hand on the door. “You’ll
be blown into the next county if you venture out
to-night.”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll turn around and let the wind blow
me back again,” retorted Patsy, undismayed by
Eleanor’s warning.</p>

<p>The two Perrys having bade their chums good
night and departed for their own room, Patsy
settled down to the writing of her letter. Though
her fountain pen fled over the paper at rapid
speed, it was half-past nine when she committed
the product of her industry to an envelope.</p>

<p>“There!” she said, as she finished writing the
address and affixed a stamp. “I’m going to put
on my fur coat and go out to the mail box with
this.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you mail it in the morning?” Beatrice
advised. “I wouldn’t go out in that wind if
I were you.”</p>

<p>“But you’re not Patsy Carroll,” laughed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
Patsy. “You’re ever so much nicer than she is,
but not half so reckless.”</p>

<p>“All right,” smiled Beatrice. “Go ahead and
be whisked into the next county. I’ll send a
search party after you in the morning.”</p>

<p>“Farewell, farewell!” declaimed Patsy, as she
dived into a closet for her fur coat. “I sha’n’t
wear a hat. The wind can’t rip off my auburn
locks no matter how hard it may try.”</p>

<p>Once out of the dormitory, Patsy had not gone
six yards before she realized that Eleanor’s prediction
was likely to be fulfilled. The gale swept
her along as if a great hand were at her back,
forcing her relentlessly forward.</p>

<p>“It’s going to be worse coming back,” she muttered,
when at last she had reached the mail box
and dropped her letter into it. “I’m certainly
going to have a real fight with this rough old
wind.”</p>

<p>Turning, she started defiantly toward the
dormitory, forging stolidly along in the teeth of
the blast.</p>

<p>Crossing the campus diagonally she was over
half way to the dormitory when of a sudden she
cried out in alarm. At the shadowed rear of the
building she had glimpsed something calculated
to inspire fear. Rising from the structure was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
thick cloud, unmistakably smoke. As she hurried
on, her heart pounding wildly, she saw that which
fully confirmed her fears. A long yellow tongue
of flame pierced the smoke cloud and shot high
above it. The dormitory was on fire!</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III<br />
<span class="smaller">NO LOSS WITHOUT GAIN</span></h2>

<p>The few rods that lay between Patsy and
the dormitory seemed miles. Flinging
open the massive front door at last, she
bounded into the corridor. To her dismay, no
sounds of excited voices or running feet were to
be heard. She could not even smell smoke.</p>

<p>Stopping only long enough to peer into the
big living room which was deserted of occupants,
she dashed down the long corridor to the heavy
double doors leading into the dining room. As
she swung one of them open and darted through,
a strong smell of burning wood assailed her
nostrils.</p>

<p>Instantly she turned and fled back to the corridor.
Under the stairs hung a large gong. Next
second it was clanging out its harsh command to
fire drill. Like every other modern institution
of learning, Yardley had its fire drill in which
every person in the dormitory was obliged to take
part.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 460px;">
<img src="images/illus2.jpg" width="460" height="650" alt="" />
<p class="caption">“We&mdash;can’t&mdash;go&mdash;that&mdash;way,” declared
the matron in a choking voice.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>Patsy’s next act was to dart to the telephone.
Though her voice quivered with excitement, as
she asked Central to turn in the fire alarm, her
head was clear and her mind in good working
order. She hoped her classmates would show no
signs of panic.</p>

<p>Soon the steady tramp, tramp of feet announced
that the fire drill was in progress. Down
the stairs and into the main corridor filed a procession
of girls, some fully dressed, others with
long coats thrown on over half-fitted negligees.
Though a buzz of voices filled the air, the
girls lined up on each side of the corridor in
orderly fashion to await further developments.</p>

<p>By this time the matron, Mrs. Ainslee, had
gained the corridor and had promptly taken
charge of the situation.</p>

<p>“The back of the dormitory is on fire!” were
Patsy’s first words to the matron. “I saw it from
the campus. I had gone out to mail a letter. I
rang the gong and turned in an alarm to Central.
It’s very serious on account of the way the wind’s
blowing. If the Alden Hose Company doesn’t
get here quick the fire will spread so fast that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
nothing can stop it. I think we ought to get
together all the buckets we can and fight it until
the fire engines get here.”</p>

<p>“A good plan,” approved Mrs. Ainslee.
“Girls,” she called out in a clear, resonant voice,
“the rear of the dormitory is on fire. First I’m
going to call the roll to be sure you are all here.
Next I need twenty-four girls, eight to each floor,
to go after the fire buckets. I will ask the first
twelve on each side at this end of the lines to go.
Stop at the second floor bath room and fill up the
buckets. We may be unable to get to the kitchen
faucets. As soon as the buckets are filled report
here for duty. The rest of you will wait until
these girls have started upstairs, then file out of
the house and onto the lawn.”</p>

<p>Turning to Patsy she said: “Stay here with
me, Miss Carroll. I need you for another purpose.”</p>

<p>With this she hurried to her office on the same
floor, returning with her register. The roll called
and everyone responding, she directed her attention
to the bucket brigade. They were soon
started in good order for the stairs. As soon as
the last girl had set foot on the stairs, the two
lines began to move toward the door. Following,
Mrs. Ainslee watched them safely outside,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
then returned to where Patsy stood waiting.</p>

<p>“You and I will investigate the fire and see
what can be done,” she said briefly, and started
down the corridor toward the dining room. In
spite of the heavy doors the smoke had now become
noticeable even in the corridor. Throwing
open one of the double doors, a dense cloud of
smoke poured over both women, causing them
to draw back in a hurry, eyes and throats
smarting.</p>

<p>“We&mdash;can’t&mdash;go&mdash;that&mdash;way,” declared the
matron in a choking voice, as she swung the door
shut. “We’ll have to fight the fire from the
outside. I’m afraid we can’t do much. It seems
to have gained a good deal of headway in a very
short time. I am going to ask you to stand in
the corridor, Miss Carroll, while I go outside. As
the girls come downstairs with the buckets, count
them. Send them out doors and to the rear of
the dormitory. I shall be there to tell them what
to do. When the last one is safely out, then
join me.”</p>

<p>Left briefly to herself, Patsy wondered what
her chums thought of her in her new position as
assistant fire chief. She had seen them in the
line, but had had no chance to exchange a word
with them. She knew Beatrice to be one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
bucket brigade, and so waited impatiently for
her return.</p>

<p>“Oh, Patsy, it’s terrible!” Beatrice called down
to her chum, as she began the descent of the
lower flight of stairs, bucket in hand. “I got
this bucket at the end of the hall near a window.
I looked out and saw the back of the dormitory.
It’s a mass of flames! Unless the fire company
comes soon the whole place will go and we’ll lose
all our clothes and belongings. I managed to
snatch my handbag and yours from the chiffonier.
One of the girls outside is keeping them
for me.”</p>

<p>“You dear, thoughtful thing!”</p>

<p>Bee had now reached the foot of the stairs.
Setting down the heavy bucket, she paused just
long enough to return the hug Patsy gave her.
Then she picked up her bucket and hurried on.</p>

<p>One by one the bucket brigade appeared, only
to disappear out the front door. Patsy kept careful
watch until the twenty-fourth girl had vanished.
By this time the smoke in the corridor was
steadily growing more dense. She doubted if the
brigade would be able to return for a second supply
of water. It was high time for her to be
moving on, she decided.</p>

<p>As she ran down the front steps of the dormitory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
and around the corner of the building toward
its rear, she could well understand why the corridor
had begun to fill with smoke. The rear of
the dormitory was now wrapped in flames.</p>

<p>Lined up as close to the fiercely blazing structure
as they dared stand, the members of the
brigade were rapidly passing their buckets on to
half a dozen girls who, under Mrs. Ainslee’s direction,
were valiantly throwing the contents of
the buckets on the flames.</p>

<p>The burning section of the dormitory was much
lower than the main part of the building, being
only two stories high. It might as well have been
four stories for all the impression that the amateur
fire fighters could make on the flames. Endeavoring
to dash the water upon the conflagration
from a safe distance, a large portion of it
fell on the ground.</p>

<p>While they toiled desperately at their hopeless
task, the welcome clanging of bells and the chug-chug
of motors announced the arrival of the
Alden Hose Company on the scene.</p>

<p>With thankful hearts, the bucket brigade
promptly vacated their posts to make way for the
firemen, who soon had a hose connected with the
nearest water main and playing vigorously upon
the flames.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>Despite their gallant efforts, the wind was
against them and the fire had gained too much
headway prior to their arrival to be easily
quenched.</p>

<p>None of the Yardley girls ever forgot that
night. Drawn up in a body at one side of the
campus they watched in terrified fascination the
conflict raging between fire and water.</p>

<p>It was between half-past nine and ten o’clock
when Patsy discovered the fire. It was after one
in the morning when water finally reduced the fire
to a state of inactivity. At least two-thirds of
the dormitory had been demolished, leaving only
the charred rafters. The front part was still
intact, due to the unceasing toil of the gallant
fire fighters. They would stick to their posts
until there remained no further possibility of the
fire taking on a new lease of life.</p>

<p>Over in Yardley Hall a weary company of
homeless girls were endeavoring to make themselves
comfortable for the rest of the night.
Aside from money and small valuables, which
the majority had had forethought enough to
hastily snatch up when the gong had sounded,
everything belonging to them had gone up in
smoke.</p>

<p>The pecuniary side of their losses was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
troubling them. There was hardly a girl at
Yardley who had not come from a home of affluence.
The discomfort they were temporarily
obliged to endure was another matter. There
was also much wild conjecturing going on among
the castaways as to what effect the disaster would
have upon the school’s routine of study.</p>

<p>Lounging wearily on a long oak bench in the
corridor, the Wayfarers were discussing the situation
amid frequent yawns.</p>

<p>“I guess we’ll just have to stay here until
morning,” Patsy was ruefully informing her
chums. “It’s after two now and we’ve no other
place to go. I’m awfully sleepy, too, but this
bench is no place to sleep.”</p>

<p>“Some of the girls have stretched out on the
benches in the class-rooms,” declared Mabel.
“We might as well do the same. Where do you
suppose we’re going to eat breakfast? I’m
hungry now.”</p>

<p>“We’re going to eat it in Alden,” announced
Patsy positively. “The minute daylight comes
we’ll hop into my car and drive to the village.
I’m hungry, too. Wish it was morning now.”</p>

<p>“This is going to make a big difference in our
Easter vacation,” reflectively remarked Beatrice.
“We’ll probably be allowed to go home to-morrow.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
With the dormitory gone there’s no other
place for us to stay until it’s rebuilt. Of course
it will be, and it won’t take very long to do it.
It isn’t as though it had been burned to the
ground. The frame work’s there and the front
of it is all right.”</p>

<p>“How long do you suppose it will take to rebuild
it?” asked Patsy eagerly. Bee’s remarks
had set her to thinking.</p>

<p>“Oh, five or six weeks,” hazarded Beatrice.
“A gang of skilled workmen can rebuild it very
quickly.”</p>

<p>“Five or six weeks,” mused Patsy.</p>

<p>Of a sudden she straightened up from her
lounging attitude, her gray eyes very bright.</p>

<p>“Girls,” she said impressively, “do you know
what this means to us? It means Palm Beach
after all. Miss Osgood has been foiled by fire.
Doesn’t that sound exactly like a movie title?
Anyway, there’s no loss without some gain. It’s
not very pleasant to be driven from home in the
middle of the night and have all one’s clothes
vanish into smoke. I’m sorry it happened, of
course. But since it <em>did</em> happen, it certainly
didn’t happen for the worst, so far as the Wayfarers
are concerned.”</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV<br />
<span class="smaller">GLORIOUS NEWS</span></h2>

<p>Beatrice’s prediction that the night’s
disaster would hasten by several days the
beginning of a prolonged Easter vacation
proved accurate. The day following the fire
was a busy one for all who had suffered from the
dire calamity. At a meeting held in the chapel
at two o’clock on the following afternoon, Miss
Osgood announced that a six weeks’ leave of absence
would be granted the pupils of Yardley.
Those who were sufficiently provided with clothing
and funds to go to their homes at once were
requested to repair to her office immediately after
the meeting. Those who were not were requested
to meet her there at four o’clock to discuss ways
and means.</p>

<p>As it happened, the Wayfarers were not only
ready to go home, but wildly impatient to go.
Early that morning they had driven to Alden in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
Patsy’s car to purchase the few things needful
for the journey. Luckily for them they had been
fully dressed when the fire alarm had sounded.
Beatrice, Mabel and Eleanor had wisely donned
hats and coats before leaving their rooms. Patsy
had put on her fur coat when she had gone out
to mail a letter. She was therefore minus a hat
only. An hour’s shopping in the village provided
the four girls with handkerchiefs, gloves
and the few other articles which they required.</p>

<p>Four o’clock that afternoon saw them at the
railway station at Alden, waiting for the four-thirty
west-bound train which would land them
in Morton shortly after ten o’clock that evening.
Patsy had already sent her aunt a lengthy telegram,
informing Miss Carroll of the fire and that
the four girls would arrive in Morton that
night.</p>

<p>Though the journey home was not a long one,
it seemed interminable to the travelers. Patsy
was burning to impart the glorious news to her
aunt. She was very sure that Aunt Martha
would reconsider her decision not to go to Palm
Beach as soon as she had been informed of the
new turn in the girls’ affairs.</p>

<p>“Morton at last!” sighed Mabel thankfully,
when at five minutes to ten that evening the scattered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
lights of the city’s suburbs began to spring
up in the darkness. “Our train is exactly on
time.”</p>

<p>“I hope Auntie will meet us,” Patsy said.
“Maybe your mother will be there, too, Perry
children; and yours, Bee. I told Auntie in my
telegram to send them word. I guess they’ll be
there, all right enough.”</p>

<p>“It seems queer not to have any luggage,
doesn’t it?” remarked Eleanor.</p>

<p>The four girls had now begun putting on their
coats, preparatory to leaving the train, which
was gradually slowing down as it neared the
station.</p>

<p>“We’re lucky to be here ourselves,” returned
Bee seriously. “If that fire had started at dead
of night it would have been a good deal worse
for us.”</p>

<p>When the train pulled into the station, however,
the Wayfarers were doomed to disappointment.
No friendly faces greeted their sight as
they stepped from the train.</p>

<p>“Auntie didn’t get my telegram! I just know
she didn’t!” Patsy cried out disappointedly. “If
she’s read about the fire in the evening papers,
I can imagine how worried she must be by this
time. It’s probably the fault of the operator at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
Alden. He looked like a sleepy old stupid.
We’d better take a taxi, children. The sooner
we get home the better it will be for our worried
folks.”</p>

<p>Hailing a taxicab the Wayfarers were soon
driving through the quiet streets of the little city
toward the beautiful suburb in which they lived.
Beatrice was the first to alight in front of the
Forbes’ unpretentious home. Promising to run
over to see Patsy the first thing the next morning,
she said “good night” and hurried up the walk.</p>

<p>“Coming in, girls?” asked Patsy as the taxicab
finally stopped in front of the high, ornamental
iron fence which enclosed the beautiful grounds
of the Carroll estate.</p>

<p>“Not to-night. We must hustle into our own
house and surprise Mother,” returned Eleanor.</p>

<p>“Good-night, then. See you in the morning.
I’ll pay the driver.”</p>

<p>Patsy hopped nimbly out of the taxicab,
handed the driver his fare with an additional coin
for good measure, then swung open the big gate
and raced up the driveway to the house.</p>

<p>Three sharp, successive rings of the electric bell
had a potent effect upon a stately, white-haired
matron who sat in the living room, making a half-hearted
attempt to read. Miss Martha Carroll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
sprang to her feet as the sound fell upon her ears
and started for the hall at a most undignified
pace. There was but one person who rang the
Carrolls’ bell in that fashion.</p>

<p>Long before the maid had time to reach the
door Miss Martha had opened it and thrown her
arms about the merry-faced, auburn-haired girl
on the threshold.</p>

<p>“Patsy Carroll, you bad child!” she exclaimed
as she gathered her niece closer to her. “Why
didn’t you telegraph me that you were all right
and coming home?”</p>

<p>“But I did, Auntie,” protested Patsy, as she
energetically hugged her relieved relative. “I
telegraphed this morning. I knew you hadn’t received
the telegram the minute I got into the
station. In it I asked you to meet me.”</p>

<p>“I never received it. Of course it will be delivered
<em>to-morrow</em>,” emphasized Miss Martha
disgustedly. “I sent one to you directly after I
read the account of the fire in the evening paper.
My nerves have been keyed up to a high pitch,
waiting for a reply to it.”</p>

<p>“Poor, dear Auntie,” cooed Patsy. “It’s a
shame. Never mind. I’m home now, so everything’s
lovely again. Let’s go into the living
room and I’ll tell you all about the fire and how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
I happened to come home to-night. Bee and
Mab and Nellie came home with me. They’ll be
over to see you in the morning.”</p>

<p>“Are you hungry, Patsy?” was her aunt’s solicitous
question as the two walked slowly into the
living room, arms twined about each other’s
waists.</p>

<p>“No, Auntie. We had dinner on the train.
I’m just crazy to talk. I’ve some glorious news
to tell you. Let’s sit on the davenport and have a
grand old talking bee.”</p>

<p>“To know you are safe is sufficiently good
news,” tenderly rejoiced Miss Martha. “Really,
Patricia, I am still trembling from the shock I
received when I opened the newspaper and saw
the headline, ‘Fire Sweeps Away Dormitory at
Yardley.’”</p>

<p>“Well, it didn’t sweep me away,” laughed
Patsy, snuggling into the circle of her aunt’s arm.
The two had now seated themselves on the big
leather davenport. “Part of the dormitory is
still there. We lost all our stuff except the
clothing we were wearing when the fire broke
out.”</p>

<p>“What started it?” questioned Miss Martha
rather severely. “The paper didn’t state the
cause. A dormitory like the one at Yardley<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
ought to be fireproof. I am sorry that I did not
visit Yardley before allowing you to enter the
school. I should certainly never countenance
your living in a place that in any way looked like
a fire-trap.”</p>

<p>“The fire started in the basement. The regular
janitor was sick and a new one took his place.
They say it was through his carelessness that it
started. He was seen to go into the basement
smoking a pipe. Something he’d been forbidden
to do. Of course, no one can be really sure that
it was his fault, though. I was the one who
gave the alarm.”</p>

<p>Patsy went on to recount the incidents of the
eventful night.</p>

<p>“Not a single girl acted scared or panicky,”
she proudly boasted. “We’d had fire drill so
often that we knew just what to do when the fire
really came. But I haven’t told you the glorious
news yet. We’re going to have <em>six</em> weeks’ vacation.
Just think of it, Aunt Martha! Isn’t that
perfectly gorgeous? Now we can go to Palm
Beach, can’t we?”</p>

<p>“So that is the glorious news,” commented
Miss Carroll.</p>

<p>For an instant she silently surveyed Patsy, a
half-smile touching her firm lips.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>“What is it, Auntie?”</p>

<p>Patsy was not slow to read peculiar significance
in both tone and smile. Something unusual
was in the wind.</p>

<p>“Would you care very much if we didn’t go to
Palm Beach?” was Miss Martha’s enigmatic
question.</p>

<p>“Of course I should,” Patsy cried out, her
bright face clouding over. “You’re not going to
say that we can’t! You mustn’t! I’ve set my
heart on the Florida trip. All the way home I’ve
been planning for it.”</p>

<p>“I received a letter from your father this morning,”
pursued Miss Carroll, ignoring Patsy’s protest.
“I also received another from Miss Osgood
in which she refused my request for the extra
week of vacation. I had written your father several
days ago regarding the making of arrangements
for us to go to Palm Beach. You can
read for yourself what he has to say.”</p>

<p>Rising, Miss Martha went over to a small
mahogany writing desk. Opening it she took a
letter from one of the pigeon holes.</p>

<p>“Here is Robert’s letter,” she said. Handing it
to her niece she reseated herself beside the latter.</p>

<p>Very eagerly Patsy took it from its envelope
and read:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">“<span class="smcap">Dear Martha</span>:</p>

<p>“Your letter came to me this morning and I
would be quick to reserve rooms for yourself and
the girls at one of the Palm Beach hotels, except
that I have a better plan. How would you like
to spend three weeks in a real southern mansion?
There is such a house on the estate I recently
bought.</p>

<p>“It is a curiously beautiful house, built after
the Spanish style of architecture, with an inner
court and many balconies. The agent from
whom I purchased it informs me that it was formerly
the property of an elderly Spaniard,
Manuel de Fereda. After his death, several
months ago, the property descended to his granddaughter,
who was anxious to sell it.</p>

<p>“It is completely furnished, much in the fashion
of houses I saw when in Mexico. The girls will
rave over it and I am very anxious that they shall
spend their holiday in it. It is not many miles
from Palm Beach and I have found a good
Indian guide who will take us on the Everglades
expedition which Patsy has set her mind on
making.</p>

<p>“Of course, if you prefer Palm Beach for the
girls, then so be it. If you come to Las Golondrinas
(The Swallows), that is the name of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
old house, you will not need to bring so many
trunks, as you will see very little of society, except
when you make an occasional trip to the
Beach. I can secure a good car for your use
while here which Patsy can drive to her heart’s
content.</p>

<p>“Let me know at once what you think of my
plan. If you decide immediately to take it up,
wire me and I will be on the lookout for you. I
believe you will enjoy this little adventure as
much as I shall. I know now what Patsy will
say. As the girls are to have only three weeks’
vacation, better arrange to start as soon as possible.</p>

<p class="center">“Affectionately,</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Robert</span>.”</p>

</div>

<p>“Aunt Martha, the Wayfarers are the luckiest
girls in the whole world,” was Patsy’s solemn assertion
as she looked up from the letter. “First
they go through a fire and come out as safely as
can be. Next they get six weeks’ vacation.
After that, Daddy plays good fairy, and finds
them a wonderful palace in the land of flowers.
All they have to do is to hurry up and take possession.
<em>When</em> are we going to start for
Florida?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>“As soon as we can make ready,” was the
prompt reply. “Since your father seems very
anxious for us to take this trip, I feel that we
ought not disappoint him. I dare say we may
find this old house he describes somewhat interesting.”</p>

<p>This calm statement filled Patsy with inward
amusement. She knew it to be an indirect admission
that her aunt was as anxious as she to
carry out the plan her father had made for them.</p>

<p>“We won’t need a lot of new gowns,” argued
Patsy. “We all have evening frocks and plenty
of wash dresses from last summer. We can wear
our corduroy suits and high boots to tramp
around in. We ought to have some of those
Palm Beach hats the stores are showing, and
new white shoes, and a few other things. It isn’t
as if we were going to stay at a large hotel. We’ll
be away from society and living outdoors most
of the time. This is Friday. I think we ought
to start south not later than next Wednesday
morning. We can’t afford to use up more than
one of our precious weeks in getting ready and
going down to Las&mdash;Las&mdash;&mdash;What’s the name
of our new home?”</p>

<p>Patsy hastily consulted her father’s letter.</p>

<p>“Las Gol-on-drinas,” she pronounced slowly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
“I suppose that’s not the way to pronounce it.
I’ll have to ask Mab about it. She’s taking
Spanish this year. It’s very necessary to know
how to say the name of our new southern home,”
she added with a chuckle. “Won’t the girls be
surprised when they hear about this splendid plan
of Father’s? Have you spoken to Mrs. Perry
about it yet, Auntie?”</p>

<p>“No, my dear. You must remember that I
received Miss Osgood’s letter, refusing my request
at the same time that I received your
father’s letter. They arrived in the first mail this
morning. I intended writing Robert this evening,
explaining that it would be impossible for
us to go to Florida. Then I read about the
fire in the paper and it completely upset my
nerves. I will call on the Perrys to-morrow
morning to talk things over. We must also call
on Mrs. Forbes.”</p>

<p>“Bee isn’t sure that her mother will let her accept
another trip from us,” confided Patsy.
“That’s the only thing I worried about after I
knew we were to have the six weeks’ vacation.
She said she was sure her mother wouldn’t feel
right about letting us pay her expenses at a fashionable
resort like Palm Beach. But it’s all different
now. Mrs. Forbes can’t very well refuse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
to let Bee accept an invitation to a house party,
can she? You must make her see it in that light,
Aunt Martha, or she won’t let Bee go with us.
She’s awfully proud, you know. We simply
must have Bee along. I wouldn’t care much
about the trip if she had to stay at home.”</p>

<p>“Beatrice will go with us,” assured Miss Martha
in a tone that indicated the intention to have
her own way in the matter. Patsy knew from
long experience that her dignified aunt was a person
not to be easily overruled, and rejoiced accordingly.</p>

<p>“I told Bee that I knew you could fix things
beautifully with her mother,” she declared happily.
“We’re going to have a wonderful time
in that quaint old house. Wouldn’t it be great
if it were haunted, or had some kind of a mystery
about it? I’ve read lots of queer stories about
those old southern mansions.”</p>

<p>“Now, Patsy,” Miss Martha made an attempt
at looking extremely severe, “once and for all
you may put such foolish notions out of your
head. That affair of the missing will at Wilderness
Lodge was, of course, quite remarkable.
Nevertheless, it was very annoying in many respects.”</p>

<p>Miss Martha had not forgotten her enforced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
hike over hill and dale on the memorable afternoon
when John, the rascally chauffeur, had set
her down in an unfamiliar territory and left her
to return to the Lodge as best she might.</p>

<p>“We are going down South for recreation.
Bear that in mind,” she continued. “The majority
of these tales about haunted houses down there
originate with the negroes, who are very ignorant
and superstitious. There is no such thing as a
<em>haunted</em> house. I have never yet met a person
who had actually <em>seen</em> a ghost. Undoubtedly we
shall hear a number of such silly tales while we
are in Florida. I am told that the natives are
very fond of relating such yarns. You girls may
listen to them if you like, but you must not take
them seriously. You are not apt ever again to
run into another mystery like that of Wilderness
Lodge.”</p>

<span class="smaller">THE LAND OF FLOWERS</span></h2>

<p>“No wonder the Spaniards named this
beautiful land ‘Florida’!” rapturously
exclaimed Beatrice Forbes. “I never
dreamed it <em>could</em> be quite so wonderful as this.”</p>

<p>“I suppose when first they saw it, they must
have felt about it as we do now,” returned Eleanor.
“According to history they landed here on
Easter Sunday. We’re seeing Florida at about
the same time of year as they first saw it. It’s
almost as wonderful to us as it was to them. Not
quite, of course, because they underwent all sorts
of hardships before they landed here. So they
must have thought it like Heaven.”</p>

<p>Exactly one week had elapsed since the Wayfarers
had arrived in Morton with the pleasing
prospect ahead of them of a six weeks’ vacation.
Three days of hurried preparation had followed.
Then had come the long, rather tiresome railway<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
journey to Florida. They had arrived at Palm
Beach late in the afternoon of the sixth day, had
been met by Mr. Carroll and had spent the night
at one of Palm Beach’s most fashionable hotels.</p>

<p>Weary from the long railway trip, the travelers
had resisted the lure of a water fête, to be
given that evening on Lake Worth, and retired
early.</p>

<p>“I can secure a boat, if you girls are anxious to
take in the fête,” Mr. Carroll had informed his
flock at dinner that evening. “This fête will be
nothing very remarkable, however. Later on,
I understand, a big Venetian fête is to be given.
Why not wait and go to that? We can easily
run up to the Beach in the car from Las Golondrinas.
I would suggest going to bed in good
season to-night. Then we can make an early
start in the morning for our new home.”</p>

<p>This program being approved by all, the Wayfarers
had dutifully settled down early for the
night. It was now a little after ten o’clock on
the following morning and the big touring car,
driven by Mr. Carroll, was bowling due south
over a palm-lined country road, toward its objective,
Las Golondrinas.</p>

<p>It was a particularly balmy morning, even for
southern Florida, where a perpetual state of fine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
weather may be expected to hold sway during
the winter months. Southward under tall palms,
past villa after villa, embowered in gorgeously
colored, flowering vines, the touring car glided
with its load of enthusiastic beauty-worshippers.</p>

<p>Seated between Miss Martha and Eleanor in
the tonneau of the machine, Beatrice was perhaps
the most ardent worshipper of them all. Love
of Nature was almost a religion with her. She
was a true child of the great outdoors.</p>

<p>“It’s so beautiful it makes me feel almost like
crying,” she confided to her companions as she
drew in a deep breath of the exquisitely scented
morning air. “It’s so different from the Adirondacks.
Up there I felt exhilarated; as though
I’d like to stand up and sing an anthem to the
mountains. But all this fragrance and color and
sunlight and warm, sweet air makes me feel&mdash;well&mdash;sentimental,”
finished Bee rather timidly.</p>

<p>“It seems more like an enchanted land out of
a fairy-tale than a real one,” mused Eleanor.
“No wonder the birds begin to fly south the minute
it grows chilly up north. They know what’s
waiting for them down here.”</p>

<p>“That’s more than we know,” smiled Beatrice,
her brown eyes dreamy. “We’re explorers, once
more, setting foot in a strange, new country.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
Something perfectly amazing may be waiting for
us just around the corner.”</p>

<p>“I hope it won’t be a horrid big snake,” shuddered
practical Mabel, who sat opposite the trio
on one of the small seats. “There are plenty of
poisonous snakes down here, you know. Moccasins
and diamond-back rattlers, coral snakes and
a good many other varieties that aren’t poisonous,
but horrible, just the same.”</p>

<p>“Why break the spell by mentioning anything
so disagreeable as snakes, Mab?” asked Eleanor
reproachfully. “I’d forgotten that there were
such hateful, wriggly things. How do you happen
to be so well up on the snakology of Florida?”</p>

<p>“There’s no such word as snakology,” retorted
Mabel. “You mean <em>herpetology</em>.”</p>

<p>“Snakology’s a fine word, even if old Noah
Webster did forget to put it in the dictionary,”
laughed Eleanor. “Isn’t it, Miss Martha?”</p>

<p>“I can’t say that I specially admire any word
pertaining to snakes,” dryly answered Miss Carroll.
“While we are on the subject, however, I
may as well say that nothing can induce me to
go on any wild expeditions into these swamps
down here. I daresay these jungles are full of
poisonous snakes. I greatly doubt the advisability<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
of allowing you girls to trail around in such
dangerous places.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we’ll be all right with a real Indian guide
to show us the way,” declared Beatrice confidently.
“White Heron is the name of our Indian
guide. Mr. Carroll was telling me about
him last night. He is a Seminole and a great
hunter.”</p>

<p>“I have no confidence in Indians,” disparaged
Miss Martha. “I sincerely hope Robert is not
mistaken in this one. I shall have to see him for
myself in order to judge whether he is a fit person
to act as guide on this foolhardy expedition
that Patsy is so set on making.”</p>

<p>This dampening assertion warned the trio of
girls that it was high time to discuss something
else. They remembered Patsy’s difficulties of
the previous summer in wringing a reluctant permission
from Miss Martha to go camping in the
mountains. Now it seemed she had again posted
herself on the wrong side of the fence. It therefore
behooved them to drop the subject where it
stood, leaving the winning over of Miss Martha
to wily Patsy and her father.</p>

<p>Seated beside her father, who, knowing the
road to Las Golondrinas, was driving the car,
Patsy was keeping up a running fire of delighted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
exclamation over the tropical beauty of the country
through which they were passing.</p>

<p>“I’m so glad you bought this splendid place,
Dad,” she rattled along in her quick, eager fashion.
“After I’m through college maybe we can
come down to Florida and spend a whole winter.”</p>

<p>“I had that idea in mind when I bought it,”
returned her father. “It will take considerable
time to put Las Golondrinas in good condition
again. Old Fereda let it run down. There are
some fine orange groves on the estate, but they
need attention. The house is in good condition.
It’s one of those old-timers and solidly built. The
grounds were in bad shape, though. I’ve had a
gang of darkies working on them ever since I
bought the place. They’re a lazy lot. Still
they’ve done quite a little toward getting the
lawns smooth again and thinning the trees and
shrubs.”</p>

<p>“Who was this Manuel de Fereda, anyway?”
questioned Patsy curiously. “I know he was
Spanish and died, and that’s all.”</p>

<p>“I know very little about him, my dear. Mr.
Haynes, the agent who sold me the property, had
never seen him. In fact, had never heard of him
until Fereda’s granddaughter put the place in his
hands for sale. She told Haynes that her grandfather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
was crazy. Haynes said she seemed very
anxious to get rid of the property and get away
from it.”</p>

<p>“There’s just enough about the whole thing to
arouse one’s curiosity,” sighed Patsy. “I’d love
to know more about this queer, crazy old Spaniard.
Maybe we’ll meet some people living near
the estate who will be able to tell us more about
him.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you’ll probably run across someone who
knows the history of the Feredas,” lightly assured
her father. “Neither the old mammy I engaged
as cook, nor the two maids can help you out,
though. They come from Miami and know no
one in the vicinity. I’m still hunting for a good,
trustworthy man for general work. We shall
need one while we’re here, to run errands, see to
the horses and make himself useful.”</p>

<p>“You must have worked awfully hard to get
things ready for us, Dad.”</p>

<p>Patsy slipped an affectionately grateful hand
into her father’s arm.</p>

<p>“I could have done better if I had known from
the start that you were really coming,” he returned.
“I had to hustle around considerably.
At least you’re here now and your aunt can be
depended upon to do the rest. I hope she will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
get along nicely with her darkie help. They’re
usually as hard to manage as a lot of unruly children.”</p>

<p>“Oh, she will,” predicted Patsy. “She always
makes everybody except Patsy do as she says.
Patsy likes to have her own way, you know.”</p>

<p>“So I’ve understood,” smiled Mr. Carroll.
“Patsy usually gets it, too, I’m sorry to say.”</p>

<p>“You’re not a bit sorry and you know it,”
flatly contradicted Patsy. “You’d hate to have
me for a daughter if I were a meek, quiet Patsy
who never had an opinion of her own.”</p>

<p>“I can’t imagine such a thing,” laughed her
father. “I’m so used to being bullied by a certain
self-willed young person that I rather like it.”</p>

<p>“You’re a dear,” gaily approved Patsy. “I
don’t ever really bully you, you know. I just tell
you what you have to do and then you go and do
it. That’s not bullying, is it?”</p>

<p>“Not in our family,” satirically assured Mr.
Carroll.</p>

<p>Whereupon they both laughed.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, as they continued to talk in the
half-jesting, intimate fashion of two persons who
thoroughly understand each other, the big black
car ate up the miles that lay between Palm Beach
and Las Golondrinas. As the party drew nearer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
their destination the highly ornamental villas
which had lined both sides of the road began to
grow fewer and farther apart. They saw less of
color and riotous bloom and more of the vivid
but monotonous green of the tropics.</p>

<p>They turned at last from the main highway and
due east into a white sandy road which ran
through a natural park of stately green pines.
Under the shadow of the pines the car continued
for a mile or so, then broke out into the open
and the sunlight again.</p>

<p>“Oh, look!”</p>

<p>Half rising in the seat, Patsy pointed. Ahead
of them and dazzlingly blue in the morning sunshine
lay the sea.</p>

<p>“How near is our new home to the ocean,
Dad?” she asked eagerly.</p>

<p>“There it is yonder.”</p>

<p>Taking a hand briefly from the wheel, Mr.
Carroll indicated a point some distance ahead
and to the right where the red-tiled roof of a
house showed in patches among the wealth of surrounding
greenery.</p>

<p>“Why, it’s only a little way from the sea!”
Patsy cried out. “Not more than half a mile, I
should judge.”</p>

<p>“About three quarters,” corrected her father.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
“The bathing beach is excellent and there’s an
old boathouse, too.”</p>

<p>“Are there any boats?” was the quick question.</p>

<p>“A couple of dinghys. Both leaky. I gave
them to one of my black fellows. Old Fereda
was evidently not a sea dog. The boathouse was
full of odds and ends of rubbish. I had it cleared
up and repainted inside and out. It will make
you a good bath house. It’s a trim looking little
shack now.”</p>

<p>Presently rounding a curve in the white, ribbon-like
road, the travelers found themselves
again riding southward. To their left, picturesque
masses of jungle sloped down to the ocean
below.</p>

<p>Soon to their right, however, a high iron fence
appeared, running parallel with the road. It
formed the eastern boundary of Las Golondrinas.
Behind it lay the estate itself, stretching levelly
toward the red-roofed house in the distance.
Long neglected by its former owner, the once
carefully kept lawns and hedges had put forth
rank, jungle-like growth. Broad-fronded palms
and palmettos drooped graceful leaves over seemingly
impenetrable thickets of tangled green.
Bush and hedge, once carefully pruned, now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
flung forth riotous untamed masses of gorgeous
bloom.</p>

<p>“It looks more like a wilderness than a private
estate,” was Patsy’s opinion as her quick eyes
roved from point to point in passing.</p>

<p>“It looked a good deal more like a jungle a few
weeks ago,” returned Mr. Carroll. “Wait until
you pass the gates; then you’ll begin to notice
a difference. The improvements my black boys
have made don’t show from the road.”</p>

<p>For a distance of half a mile, the car continued
on the sandy highway. At last Mr. Carroll
brought it to a stop before the tall, wrought-iron
gates of the main entrance to the estate. Springing
from the automobile, he went forward to
open them.</p>

<p>“Every man his own gate-opener,” he called
out jovially. “Drive ahead, Patsy girl.”</p>

<p>Patsy had already slipped into the driver’s
seat, hands on the wheel. Immediately her father
called out, she drove the machine slowly forward
and through the now wide-open gateway.</p>

<p>“Do let me drive the rest of the way, Dad,”
she implored as Mr. Carroll regained the car.</p>

<p>“All right. Follow this trail wherever it goes
and you’ll finally bring up at the house,” was the
good-humored injunction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>By “trail” Mr. Carroll meant the drive, which,
flanked by hedges of perfumed oleander, wound
through the grounds, describing a sweeping curve
as it approached the quaint, grayish-white building
that had for generations sheltered the Feredas.
A little beyond the house and to its rear,
they glimpsed rank upon rank of orange trees,
on which golden fruit and creamy blossoms hung
together amongst the glossy green of foliage.</p>

<p>A light land breeze, freighted with the fragrance
of many flowers, blew softly upon the
Wayfarers. Its scented sweetness filled them
with fresh delight and appreciation of their new
home.</p>

<p>Patsy brought the car to a stop on the drive,
directly in front of an arched doorway, situated
at the center of the facade. Before the travelers
had time to step out of the automobile the
massive double doors were swung open by a stout,
turbaned mammy, the true southern type of
negro, fast vanishing from the latter day, modernized
South. Her fat, black face radiant with
good will, she showed two rows of strong white
teeth in a broad smile. Beside her stood two
young colored girls who stared rather shyly at
the newcomers.</p>

<p>“I done see yoh comin’, Massa Carroll!” she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
exclaimed. “I see yoh way down de road. So
I done tell Celia an’ Em’ly here, y’all come along
now, right smart, an’ show Massa Carroll’s folks
yoh got some manners.’”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Mammy Luce,” gallantly responded
Mr. Carroll, his blue eyes twinkling with
amusement. Whereupon he gravely presented
the gratified old servant to his “folks.” A courtesy
which she acknowledged with an even greater
display of teeth and many bobbing bows.</p>

<p>Headed by Mr. Carroll, the travelers stepped
over the threshold of Las Golondrinas and into
the coolness of a short stone passageway which
ended in the patio or square stone court, common
to houses of Spanish architecture.</p>

<p>In the center of the court a fountain sent up
graceful sprays of water, which fell sparkling
into the ancient stone bowl built to receive the
silvery deluge. Above the court on three sides
ranged the inevitable balconies. Looking far
upward one glimpsed, through the square opening,
a patch of blue sunlit sky.</p>

<p>“Welcome to Las Golondrinas, girls! It’s
rather different from anything you’ve ever seen
before, now isn’t it?”</p>

<p>Mr. Carroll addressed the question to his flock
in general, who had stopped in the center of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
court to take stock of their new environment.</p>

<p>“It’s positively romantic!” declared Patsy fervently.
“I feel as though I’d stepped into the
middle of an old Spanish tale. I’m sure Las
Golondrinas must have a wonderful history of
its own. When you stop to remember how many
different Feredas have lived here, you can’t help
feeling that a lot of interesting, perhaps tragic
things may have happened to them. I only wish
I knew more about them.”</p>

<p>“Let the poor dead and gone Feredas rest in
peace, Patsy,” laughingly admonished Eleanor.
“We came down here to enjoy ourselves, not to
dig up the tragic history of a lot of Spanish Dons
and Donnas.”</p>

<p>“A very sensible remark, Eleanor,” broke in
Miss Martha emphatically. “There is no reason
that I can see why you, Patsy, should immediately
jump to the conclusion that this old house
has a tragic history. It’s pure nonsense, and I
don’t approve of your filling your head with such
ideas. I dare say the history of these Feredas
contains nothing either startling or tragic. Don’t
let such ridiculous notions influence you to spend
what ought to be a pleasant period of relaxation
in trying to conjure up a mystery that never
existed.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>“Now, Auntie, you know perfectly well that
if we happened to stumble upon something simply
amazing in this curious old house, you’d be just
as excited over it as any of us,” gaily declared
Patsy.</p>

<p>“‘Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof,’”
loftily quoted Miss Martha, refusing to commit
herself. “It will take something very amazing
indeed to impress me.”</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI<br />
<span class="smaller">THE BEGINNING OF ADVENTURE</span></h2>

<p>“The time has come, O Wayfarers, to
think of many things,” gaily declaimed
Patsy, bursting into the somber, high-ceilinged,
dark-paneled sitting-room where Miss
Martha, Beatrice, Mabel and Eleanor sat around
a massive mahogany table, busily engaged in writing
letters.</p>

<p>“Go away, Patsy,” laughingly admonished
Mabel, pen suspended in mid-air over her note
paper. “You’re a disturber. You’ve made me
forget what I was going to write next. If you
won’t be a letter-writer, don’t be a nuisance.”</p>

<p>“I can’t be what I never have been and could
never possibly become,” retorted Patsy. “I’ll
promise to keep quiet, though, if you’ll all hustle
and finish your letters. I’m dying to go over to
the orange groves and it’s no fun going alone.
Any old person will do for company.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>“Then we <em>won’t</em> do,” emphasized Beatrice.
“We are very distinguished persons who don’t
belong in the ‘any old’ class.”</p>

<p>“Glad you told me,” chuckled Patsy. “I’ll
give you ten minutes to wind up your letters. If
you’re not done then&mdash;well&mdash;I’ll give you ten
more. I am always considerate. I’m going to
leave you now, but I shall return. I’ll come buzzing
around again, like a pestiferous fly, in exactly
ten minutes by my wrist watch. I’m only going
as far as the gallery to pay my respects to the
dead and gone Feredas.”</p>

<p>With this announcement Patsy turned and
strolled from the room. The gallery to which she
referred was in the nature of a short corridor,
extending between the second-floor sitting-room
and ending at the corridor on which were situated
sleeping rooms which the Wayfarers occupied.
It had evidently served as a picture
gallery for several generations of Feredas. Its
walls were lined with a heterogeneous collection
of oil paintings, largely landscape and studies in
still life. At least half of one side of it, however,
was devoted strictly to portraits. It was before
this particular section that Patsy halted.</p>

<p>Two days had elapsed since the Wayfarers had
made port at Las Golondrinas. On the evening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
of their arrival, a storm had come up, bursting
over the old house in all its tropical fury.
Following it, rain had set in and for two days had
continued to fall in a steady, discouraging downpour
that made out-door excursions impossible
for the time being.</p>

<p>Now, on the third morning since their arrival,
the sun again shone gloriously, in skies of cerulean
blue, and the air was heavy with the sweetness
of rain-washed blossoms. It was an ideal
morning to spend out of doors, and Patsy was
impatient to start on an exploring tour of the
estate.</p>

<p>During the two days in which the Wayfarers
had been kept indoors by the rain, they had become
thoroughly acquainted with the old house.
They had wandered about it from cellar to roof,
marveling at its utter unlikeness to any other
house in which they had ever set foot. Its somber,
spacious rooms with their highly polished
floors and queer, elaborately carved, foreign-looking
furniture of a by-gone period, evoked volleys
of wondering comment and speculation. The
cool patio with its silver-spraying fountain, the
long windows opening out onto picturesque balconies
and the dim stone corridors, all held for
them the very acme of romance. It was like being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
set down in a world which they had known
only in fiction.</p>

<p>Each girl had found some one particular object
on which to fix her special admiration. Eleanor
went into ecstasies over a huge, carved-leather
chest that stood in the sitting-room. Beatrice
was enthusiastic over a heavy mahogany book-case
filled with old Spanish volumes, bound in
boards and parchment. She loudly deplored her
inability to read Spanish and announced her intention
of tackling the fascinating volumes with
the aid of a Spanish-English dictionary which
Mabel had brought along. Mabel was vastly impressed
by a high, frowning old desk with many
drawers and pigeon-holes. She was perfectly
sure, she declared, that it must contain a secret
drawer, and in consequence spent the great part
of an afternoon in an unavailing hunt for it.</p>

<p>Patsy found unending delight in the portrait
section of the picture gallery. The dark-eyed,
tight-lipped men and women who stared down
at her from the wall filled her with an intense
curiosity regarding who they were and how long
it had been since they had lived and played their
parts in the history of the Feredas.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly they were all Feredas. Of unmistakably
Spanish cast of countenance, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
bore a decided family resemblance to one another.
The difference in the style of dress worn
by the pictured folk proclaimed them to be of
many generations. How far removed from the
present day, she did not know. She was of the
opinion that some of them must have lived at
least two hundred years ago. She was very sure
that one portrait, that of a man, must have been
painted even earlier than that.</p>

<p>It was this portrait in particular which most
fascinated her. Hung in the center of the section
and framed in tarnished gilt, it depicted the
full length figure of a Spanish cavalier. Patsy
thought he might easily have been one of the intrepid,
Latin adventurers who accompanied
Ponce de Leon on his unsuccessful quest into
Florida for the fabled Fountain of Youth.</p>

<p>As a gallant of long ago, the man in the picture
instantly arrested her attention. The thin, sinister
face above the high Spanish ruff repelled her,
however. The bright, bird-like eyes, the long,
aquiline nose and the narrow lips, touched with
a mocking smile, combined to make a countenance
of such intense cruelty as filled her with a curious
sense of terror. It was as if the sharp, black eyes
followed her, as she moved along from picture to
picture. There was a peculiar, life-like quality<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
about the painting which gave her the uncomfortable
feeling that the sinister cavalier might step
down from the canvas at any moment.</p>

<p>Nevertheless she could not refrain from stopping
to look at him every time she passed through
the corridor. She was convinced that he must
have been the first Fereda who landed in the New
World and that he had a record which might well
match his malevolently smiling face. It piqued
her not a little to reflect, that, who he was and
what he had been would in all probability ever
remain a mystery to her.</p>

<p>Strolling into the corridor that morning to
study again the provoking object of her curiosity,
Patsy wondered how the granddaughter
of old Manuel de Fereda could ever have been
content to turn over the contents of Las Golondrinas
to strangers. She wondered what had become
of her. She was undoubtedly the only one
who knew the identity of the painted cavalier.
Patsy decided that she would ask her father to
write Mr. Haynes, the agent, from whom he had
purchased the property, asking him for Eulalie
Fereda’s address. Once she had obtained it,
Patsy fully intended to write to the Spanish girl
for information concerning the painted cavalier.</p>

<p>Wrapped in meditation, she did not hear Beatrice’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
light approaching footsteps until her friend
had traversed half of the corridor.</p>

<p>“Oh, Bee!” she hailed, as the latter paused beside
her. “I’m going to try to get Eulalie Fereda’s
address from Mr. Haynes, and then write
her about this picture. It seems queer that she
allowed all these portraits of her family to be
sold with the house, now doesn’t it? I certainly
shouldn’t care to see the pictures of my respected
ancestors pass into the hands of strangers.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps she’d lived here so long with her
grandfather that she’d grown tired of him and
all the rest of the Fereda tribe,” hazarded Bee.
“Imagine how lonely it would be for a young girl
in this gloomy old house. It <em>is</em> gloomy, you know.
We don’t mind it because there are a crowd of us.
It all seems just quaint and romantic to us.”</p>

<p>“All except Auntie,” reminded Patsy, smiling.
“She says that the whole house ought to be done
over from top to bottom and that she intends to
come down here next fall and see to it herself.
I think she only half means it, though. She likes
it the way it is, just as much as we do, but she
won’t admit it. Aunt Martha has a real love
for the romantic, but she tries hard not to let any
one know it.”</p>

<p>“The furniture in this house must be really<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
valuable,” Bee said seriously. “Most of it is
antique. Goodness knows how old that desk in
the sitting-room is; and that carved-leather chest
and the book-case. Why, those books alone must
be worth a good deal. A book collector would
rave over them. I wish I knew something about
rare volumes and first editions. If I were your
father I’d send for an expert and have the collection
valued.”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell him about it,” nodded Patsy. “Only
he won’t bother to do it while we’re here. He’s
more interested in having the grounds put in order
than anything else. He says the orange
groves are not worth much because they’ve been
neglected for so long. With care, he thinks they’ll
do better next year. We’ve come down here too
late for the real fruit season, you know. We
should have been here in January or February
for that. Anyway, he didn’t buy this place as a
money-making venture. He thought it would be
a nice winter home for us.”</p>

<p>“I’m lucky to have the chance to see it,” congratulated
Beatrice. “If ever I become a writer,
I shall put Las Golondrinas into a story. That’s
a pretty name; Las Golondrinas.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t it, though. I suppose it was named on
account of the tree swallows,” mused Patsy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
“Dad says there are flocks of them here. They
have blue backs and white breasts. I’m sure I
saw some this morning. Oh, dear! I wish the
girls would hurry. I want to start out and see
the sights. Come on. Let’s remind them that
time is flying.”</p>

<p>Catching Bee by the hand, Patsy pulled her,
a willing captive, toward the sitting-room.</p>

<p>“Time’s up and more than up!” she announced,
poking her auburn head into the big room.</p>

<p>“I’m ready,” responded Eleanor, rising from
her chair.</p>

<p>“So am I&mdash;in another minute.”</p>

<p>Hastily addressing an envelope to her mother,
Mabel tucked her letter into it, sealed and
stamped it.</p>

<p>“There!” she ejaculated as she laid it on the
little pile of letters which represented the fruits
of the morning’s labor. “That’s off my mind.”</p>

<p>“What about you, Auntie?” questioned Patsy,
noting that her dignified relative was still engaged
in letter-writing. “Don’t you want to join
the explorers?”</p>

<p>“You girls can get along very well without
me,” placidly returned Miss Carroll. “I am not
through with my writing. Besides, I don’t feel
inclined to go exploring this morning. I warn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
all of you to be careful where you set foot. This
old place may be infested with snakes.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we’ll be careful. We’ll each carry a
good stout stick,” assured Beatrice. “That’s the
way tourists do in the tropics, you know. On
some of the South Sea Islands, I’ve read that
tourists always carry what they call ‘snake sticks’
when they go calling. At night the coolies go
ahead of a calling party and beat the long grass
aside.”</p>

<p>“Very fine, Bee. I hereby appoint you chief
grass-beater of the realm,” teased Mabel.</p>

<p>“I decline the high office,” retorted Bee.
“Every Wayfarer will have to do her own bit of
trail beating. As I am <em>very</em> brave, I don’t mind
walking ahead, though.”</p>

<p>“I will walk with you, Bee,” graciously offered
Patsy. “Woe be to the wriggly, jiggly sarpint
that crosses our path.”</p>

<p>In this light strain the four girls left Miss Martha
to her writing and sallied forth from the coolness
of the old house into the bright sunlight.</p>

<p>“Where shall we go first?” queried Patsy, as
they paused on the drive in front of the house.
“Shall we get acquainted with our numerous
acres of front yard, or shall we make a bee-line
for the orange groves?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>“Let’s do the groves first,” suggested Eleanor.
“I’m awfully anxious to get close to real orange
trees with real oranges growing on them.”</p>

<p>“Come on, then.”</p>

<p>Seizing Beatrice by the arm, Patsy piloted her
around a corner of the house, Mabel and Eleanor
following.</p>

<p>Crossing a comparatively smooth bit of lawn,
at the rear of the house, the Wayfarers halted by
common consent before proceeding further. Between
them and the orange groves lay a wide
stretch of ground, fairly overrun with tangled
bush and vine. Magnificent live oak, cedar and
palmetto trees, spread their noble branches over
thickets of bright bloom and living green. It
was extremely picturesque, but “very snaky,” as
Mabel declared with a little shudder.</p>

<p>“There’s a darkie over yonder, clipping away
that thicket!” Eleanor pointed to where an
ancient, bare-footed, overalled African, wearing
a huge, tattered straw hat, was industriously cutting
away at a thick patch of sprawling green
growth.</p>

<p>“Hey, there, Uncle!” called out undignified
Patsy. “Come here a minute, please.”</p>

<p>The old man straightened up at the hail and
looked rather blankly about him. Catching sight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
of the group of white-clad girls, he ambled slowly
toward them through the long grass.</p>

<p>“Mornin’, young ladies,” he saluted, pulling off
his ragged headgear and disclosing a thick crop
of snow-white wool. “Ah reckin mebbe yoh
wants Uncle Jemmy t’ tell yoh suthin’?”</p>

<p>“Yes, we do, Uncle,” beamed Patsy. “We
wish you’d show us a path to the orange groves,
if there is one. We’d like to have some good,
stout sticks, too, in case we see any snakes.
Aren’t you afraid to walk around in that jungle
in your bare feet?”</p>

<p>“Laws, Missie, I’se used toh it, I is. Th’ ain’t
no snaikes round heah what mounts toh much. I
done see a big black snaike this mohnin’, but that
fella ain’t out toh do me no damage. He am a
useful snaike, he am.”</p>

<p>“We’ll be just as well satisfied not to meet his
snakeship, even if he is so useful,” muttered Eleanor
in Patsy’s ear.</p>

<p>“Ef yoh all young ladies’ll come along now,
I’se gwine toh show yoh the way toh git toh the
orange groves,” continued Uncle Jemmy.
“There am a path ovah heah.”</p>

<p>So saying, the old man took the lead and
trotted along the clipped lawn where it skirted
the high grass for a distance of perhaps twenty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
yards. The girls followed him, single file, every
pair of bright eyes intent on trying to catch a
glimpse of the path.</p>

<p>Pausing at last, Uncle Jemmy proceeded to
lop off several low-growing branches from a
nearby tree. These he deftly stripped clear of
twigs and foliage and, trimming them smooth
with a huge, sharp-bladed pocket knife, presented
one to each of the four explorers.</p>

<p>“Heah am yoh snaike sticks, young ladies,” he
declared, showing a vast expanse of white teeth
in a genial grin. “Now I’se gwine to take yoh
a little furder an’ yoh’ll see de path.”</p>

<p>A few steps and they came abreast of a giant
oak tree and here the path began, a narrow trail,
but beaten hard by the passing of countless feet.</p>

<p>“Yoh jes’ follow de path whereber he goes and
yoh-all gwine come af’er while toh de groves,”
he directed.</p>

<p>“Thank you, Uncle Jemmy.” Patsy nodded
radiant thanks. Seized by a sudden thought she
asked: “Do you live around here?”</p>

<p>“No, Missie. I comes from Tampa, I does.
Soon’s I git through this job foh Massa Carroll
I gwine toh git right back toh Tampa again. It
am de bes’ place fo’ Uncle Jemmy.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” Patsy’s face fell. Then she tried again.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
“Do any of these boys working with you live
around here?”</p>

<p>“No, Missie. They done come from Miami.
We am all strangahs heah.”</p>

<p>“I see. Thank you ever so much for helping
us.”</p>

<p>With a kindly nod to the old man, Patsy turned
to her chums who had stood listening in silence
to the questions she had asked.</p>

<p>“Are you ready for the great adventure?” she
queried. “Come along, then. One, two, three
and away we go, Indian fashion!”</p>

<p>Bidding a smiling good-bye to Uncle Jemmy,
who had now turned to go, the three girls filed
into the trail behind their energetic leader. And
thus the Wayfarers started off on what really
was the beginning of a greater adventure than
they dreamed.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII<br />
<span class="smaller">THE COTTAGE IN THE PALM GROVE</span></h2>

<p>Greatly to their relief, the Wayfarers
were not called upon to do battle with
their stout snake sticks. For a quarter
of a mile they followed the narrow path. It
wound in and out of the tall, coarse grass and
around wide-spreading trees and ragged clumps
of bushes. At length they reached the point for
which they had been aiming.</p>

<p>“It’s simply splendiferous!” exclaimed Eleanor,
as the quartette halted well inside the first
grove to breathe in the fragrance of orange blossoms
and feast their eyes on the beauty of the
tropical scene spread out before them.</p>

<p>“Why, it isn’t just an orange grove!” Beatrice
cried out. “Look, girls! There are <em>lemons</em> on
that tree over yonder!”</p>

<p>“Yes, and see the tangerines!” Patsy pointed
out. “Those stiff, funny bushes there have kumquats<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
on them. And I do believe&mdash;yes, sir&mdash;that
ragged old tree there is a banana tree. This is
what I call a mixed-up old grove. I supposed
oranges grew in one grove and lemons in another,
etc., etc.”</p>

<p>“I guess we don’t know very much about it,”
laughed Eleanor. “We’ll have to get busy and
learn what’s what and why. Let’s walk on
through this grove and see what’s in the next one.
There seems to be a pretty good path down
through it.”</p>

<p>Amid many admiring exclamations, the Wayfarers
strolled on, seeing new wonders with every
step they took. The brown, woody litter which
covered the ground under the trees was plentifully
starred with the white of fallen blossoms.
To quote Mabel, “Why, we’re actually walking
on flowers!”</p>

<p>Late in the season as it was they found considerable
fruit growing within easy reach of their
hands. Eager to avail themselves of the pleasure
of “actually picking oranges from the trees,” the
girls gathered a modest quantity of oranges and
tangerines.</p>

<p>Warned by Mr. Carroll always to be on the
watch for spiders, scorpions and wood-ticks before
sitting down on the ground, Beatrice and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
Patsy energetically swept a place clear with a
huge fallen palmetto leaf, and the four seated
themselves on the dry, clean-swept space to enjoy
their spoils.</p>

<p>All of them had yet to become adepts in the
art of out-door orange eating as it is done in
Florida. In consequence, they had a very delightful
but exceedingly messy feast. Picking
oranges at random also resulted in their finding
some of the fruit sour enough to set their teeth
on edge. These they promptly flung from them
and went on to others more palatable.</p>

<p>“No more oranges for me this morning,” finally
declared Eleanor, pitching the half-eaten
one in her hand across the grove. “I’m soaked
in juice from head to foot. Look at my skirt.”</p>

<p>“I’ve had enough.” Bee sprang to her feet,
drying her hands on her handkerchief. “We
ought to pick a few oranges to take to Miss Martha.”</p>

<p>“Let’s get them when we come back,” proposed
Patsy. “What’s the use in lugging them around
with us. I want to walk all the way through
these groves to the end of the estate. Dad says
it’s not more than a mile from the house to the
west end of Las Golondrinas.”</p>

<p>“All right. Lead on, my dear Miss Carroll,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
agreed Bee with a low bow. “Be sure you know
where you’re going, though.”</p>

<p>“I know just as much about where I’m going
as you do,” merrily flung back Patsy over her
shoulder.</p>

<p>Headed by their intrepid leader, the little procession
once more took the trail, wandering happily
along under the scented sweetness of the
orange trees. Overhead, bright-plumaged birds
flew about among the gently stirring foliage.
Huge golden and black butterflies fluttered past
them. Among the white and gold of blossom,
bees hummed a deep, steady song as they pursued
their endless task of honey-gathering.</p>

<p>On and on they went, passing through one
grove after another until they glimpsed ahead the
high, wrought-iron fence which shut in the estate
on all four sides. Reaching it, they could look
through to a small grassy open space beyond.
Behind it rose a natural grove of tall palms. Set
down fairly in the middle of the grove was a
squat, weather-stained cottage of grayish stone.</p>

<p>“Oh, see that funny little house!” was Mabel’s
interested exclamation. “I wonder whom it belongs
to!”</p>

<p>“Let’s go over and pay it a visit,” instantly
proposed Patsy. “Perhaps someone lives there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
who can tell us about old Manuel Fereda and
Eulalie, his granddaughter. It doesn’t look as
though darkies lived there. Their houses are
mostly tumble-down wooden shacks. Still it may
be deserted. Anyway, we might as well go over
and take a look at it.”</p>

<p>“How are we going to get out of here?” asked
Eleanor. “I don’t see a gate.”</p>

<p>“There must be one somewhere along the west
end,” declared Bee. “Let’s start here and follow
the fence. Maybe we’ll come to one.”</p>

<p>“We’d better walk north through the grove
then. There’s no path close to the fence and that
grass is too high and jungly looking to suit me,”
demurred Eleanor.</p>

<p>Traveling northward through the grove, their
eyes fixed on the fence in the hope of spying a
gate, the explorers walked some distance, but
saw no sign of one. Finally retracing their steps
to their starting point, they headed south and
eventually discovered, not a gate, but a gap in
the fence where the lower part of several iron
palings had been broken away, leaving an aperture
large enough for a man to crawl through.</p>

<p>“This means us,” called Patsy and ran toward
it.</p>

<p>Energetically beating down the grass under it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
with the stick she carried, she stooped and scrambled
through to the other side, emitting a little
whoop of triumph as she stood erect.</p>

<p>One by one her three companions followed
suit until the four girls were standing on the
grassy clearing, which, a few rods farther on,
merged levelly into the grove of palms surrounding
the low stone cottage.</p>

<p>From the point at which they now halted they
could obtain only a side view of it among the
trees.</p>

<p>“Judging from the big cobweb on one of those
windows, I should say no one lives there,” commented
Eleanor.</p>

<p>“It <em>does</em> look deserted. Let’s go around to
the front of it. Then we can tell more about it,”
suggested Patsy.</p>

<p>Crossing the grassy space, the quartette entered
the shady grove. A few steps brought them
abreast of the front of the cottage.</p>

<p>“The door’s wide open! I wonder&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Patsy broke off abruptly, her gray eyes focussing
themselves upon the open doorway. In it had
suddenly appeared a woman, so tall that her head
missed but a little of touching the top of the
rather low aperture. For an instant she stood
there, motionless, staring or rather glaring at her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
uninvited visitors out of a pair of wild black eyes.
The Wayfarers were staring equally hard at her,
fascinated by this strange apparition.</p>

<p>What they saw was a fierce, swarthy countenance,
broad and deeply lined. The woman’s
massive head was crowned by a mop of snow-white
hair that stood out in a brush above her terrifying
features. A beak-like nose, a mouth that
was merely a hard line set above a long, pointed
chin, gave her the exact look of the proverbial
old witch. Over the shoulders of a shapeless,
grayish dress, which fell in straight ugly folds
to her feet, she wore a bright scarlet shawl. It
merely accentuated the witch-like effect.</p>

<p>In sinister silence she took the one stone step
to the ground and began to move slowly forward
toward the group of girls, a deep scowl drawing
her bushy white brows together until they met.</p>

<p>“She’s crazy!” came from Mabel, in a terrified
whisper. “Let’s run.”</p>

<p>“I will <em>not</em>,” muttered Patsy. “I’m going to
speak to her.”</p>

<p>Stepping boldly forward to meet the advancing
figure, Patsy smiled winningly, and said:
“Good-morning.”</p>

<p>“What you want?” demanded a harsh voice.</p>

<p>Ignoring Patsy’s polite salutation, the fearsome<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
old woman continued to advance, halting
within four or five feet of the group of girls.</p>

<p>“Oh, we were just taking a walk,” Patsy
brightly assured. “We saw this cottage and
thought we’d like to see who lived here.
We&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Where you live?” sharply cut in the woman.</p>

<p>“We are staying at Las Golondrinas. My
father owns the property now. I am Patricia
Carroll and these three girls are my chums,”
amiably explained Patsy. “We are anxious to
find someone who can tell us something about the
Feredas. We are looking for&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You will never find!” was the shrieking interruption.
“It is not for you, white-faced thieves!
<i lang="es">Madre de Dios!</i> Old Camillo has hidden it too
well. Away with you! Go, and return no more!”</p>

<p>This tempestuous invitation to begone was accompanied
by a wild waving of the woman’s long
arms. The gold hoop rings in her ears shook and
swayed as she wagged a menacing head at the
intruders.</p>

<p>“Just a minute and we will go.”</p>

<p>Undismayed by the unexpected burst of fury
on the part of the disagreeable old woman, Patsy
stood her ground unflinchingly. There was an
angry sparkle in her gray eyes, however, and her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
voice quivered with resentment as she continued
hotly:</p>

<p>“I want you distinctly to understand that we
are <em>not</em> thieves, even though we happen to be
trespassers. When we saw this cottage we
thought it might belong to some one who had
lived here a long time and had been well acquainted
with Manuel Fereda and his granddaughter,
Eulalie&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Eulalie! Ah-h! <i lang="es">Ingrata!</i> May she never
rest! May the spirit of old Camillo give her no
peace!”</p>

<p>Here the strange, fierce old creature broke
into a torrent of Spanish, her voice gathering
shrillness with every word. She appeared to have
forgotten the presence of the Wayfarers and directed
her tirade at the absent Eulalie, who was
evidently very much in her bad graces.</p>

<p>“Come on. Let her rave. She surely is crazy.
She may try to hurt us,” murmured Eleanor in
Patsy’s ear.</p>

<p>“All right. Come on, girls.”</p>

<p>Tucking her arm in Eleanor’s, Patsy turned
abruptly away from the ancient belligerent who
was still waving her arms and sputtering unintelligibly.</p>

<p>Without a word the quartette hurried out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
the palm grove, across the grassy space and made
safe port on their own territory, through the gap
in the fence. This accomplished, curiosity impelled
each girl to peer through the palings for
a last glimpse at the tempestuous cottager.</p>

<p>She had not been too busy anathematizing the
unlucky Eulalie to be unaware of the hasty retreat
of her unwelcome visitors. She had now
stopped flapping her arms and was bending far
forward, her fierce old eyes directed to where the
Wayfarers had taken prudent refuge. Noting
that they were watching her, she shook a fist savagely
at them, threw up both arms menacingly
as though imploring some unseen force to visit
vengeance upon them, and bolted for the cottage.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII<br />
<span class="smaller">PATSY SCENTS A MYSTERY</span></h2>

<p>“Now <em>who</em> do you suppose <em>she</em> is?” broke
from Bee, as the old woman disappeared.</p>

<p>“Ask me something easier,” shrugged Patsy.
“She’s a regular old witch, isn’t she? Dad must
know who she is. Funny he never said anything
about her to us. Suppose we trot back to the
house and watch for him. He promised, you
know, at breakfast, to be back from Palm Beach
in time for luncheon so as to take us down to the
boathouse this afternoon. He had a business appointment
with a man at the Beach. That’s
why he hurried away so fast this morning.”</p>

<p>Suiting the action to the word, the Wayfarers
started back through the orange groves, discussing
with animation the little adventure with
which they had recently met.</p>

<p>“That woman was Spanish, of course,” declared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
Beatrice. “Could you understand her, Mab,
when she trailed off into Spanish, all of a sudden?
She said ‘ingrata.’ I caught that much.
What does it mean?”</p>

<p>“It means ‘the ungrateful one,’” Mabel answered.
“I couldn’t understand much of what
she said. I caught the words, ‘Camillo, Manuel,
Eulalie,’ and something about a spirit torturing
somebody&mdash;Eulalie, I suppose she meant. ‘Madre
de Dios’ means ‘Mother of God,’ or ‘Holy
Mother.’ It’s a very common form of expression
among the Mexicans. I believe this woman is a
Mexican.”</p>

<p>“We know who Eulalie is. By Manuel she
must have meant the Manuel Fereda who died
just a little while ago,” said Bee reflectively.
“But who in the world is or was old Camillo?
And what did he hide? What made her call us
‘white-faced thieves’? What is it that we’ll never
find? Will somebody please answer these simple
questions?”</p>

<p>“Answer them yourself,” challenged Patsy
gaily. “We’ll be delighted to have you do it.
You know you are fond of puzzling things out.”</p>

<p>“It sounds&mdash;well&mdash;&mdash;” Bee laughed, hesitated,
then added: “Mysterious.”</p>

<p>“Exactly,” warmly concurred Patsy. “We’ve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
actually stumbled upon something mysterious
the very first thing. I knew, all the time, that
we were going to find something queer about this
old place.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think there’s anything very mysterious
about a tousle-headed old crazy woman,”
sniffed Mabel. “She certainly didn’t act like a
sane person. Maybe she had delusions or something
of the sort.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps <em>her</em> name is Camillo,” suggested
Bee, her mind still occupied with trying to figure
out to whom the name belonged.</p>

<p>“No.” Mabel shook her head. “Camillo is a
<em>man’s</em> name, not a woman’s. She might have
meant her husband or her brother. Goodness
knows whom she meant. I tell you, she’s a lunatic
and that’s all there is to it. If we hadn’t been
armed with four big sticks she might have laid
hands on us.”</p>

<p>“Well, Uncle Jemmy’s snake sticks were some
protection, anyhow,” laughed Eleanor. “I’m
going to keep mine and lug it around with me
wherever I go. I may&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>A wild shriek from Mabel left the sentence
unfinished. Walking a pace or two ahead of the
others, Mabel had almost stumbled upon a huge
black snake, coiled in a sunny spot between the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
trees. Quite as much startled as she, the big,
harmless reptile uncoiled his shining black folds
in a hurry and slid for cover.</p>

<p>“Oh!” she gasped. “Did you <em>see</em> him? He
was a whopper! And I almost stepped on him!
He might have bitten me.”</p>

<p>“Black snakes don’t bite, you goose,” reassured
intrepid Patsy. “He was probably more
scared at the yell you gave than you were to
see him. He must be the same one Uncle Jemmy
saw this morning.”</p>

<p>“Maybe he’s been raised a pet,” giggled Eleanor.
“We may get to know him well enough to
speak to when we fall over him coiled up on various
parts of the estate. If you ever get really
well acquainted with him, Mab, you can apologize
to him for yelling in his ears.”</p>

<p>“First find his ears,” jeered Mabel, who had
sufficiently recovered from the scare to retaliate.</p>

<p>“Our second adventure,” commented Beatrice.
“Wonder what the next will be.”</p>

<p>“Nothing more weird or exciting than luncheon,
I guess,” said Patsy. “There! We forgot
to pick those oranges we were going to take to
Auntie.”</p>

<p>“Let’s go back and get them,” proposed Eleanor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, never mind. I dare say there are plenty
of oranges at the house,” returned Patsy.
“Auntie won’t mind. We’ll go down to the grove
to-morrow and pick a whole basketful for her.”</p>

<p>By this time the Wayfarers were nearing the
house. Rounding a corner of the building they
spied Mr. Carroll some distance down the drive.
He was sitting in his car engaged in conversation
with a white man who stood beside it. Both
men were too far away from the girls for them
to be able to make out plainly the stranger’s features.
They could tell little about him save that
he was tall, slim, dark and roughly dressed.</p>

<p>“That must be the new man,” instantly surmised
Patsy.</p>

<p>Pausing, she shaded her eyes with one hand, to
shut out the glaring sunlight, and stared curiously
at the stranger.</p>

<p>“Can’t tell much about him,” she remarked.
“There; he’s started down the drive. Now we’ll
find out from Dad who he is.”</p>

<p>The stranger, having turned away, Mr. Carroll
had started the car and was coming slowly up the
drive. Sighting the group of white-clad girls he
waved to them.</p>

<p>“Hello, children!” he saluted, as he stopped the
car within a few feet of them. “Where have you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
been spending the morning? Want to ride up
to the house?”</p>

<p>“No, thank you,” was the answering chorus, as
the girls gathered about the automobile.</p>

<p>“We’ve been exploring, Dad,” informed
Patsy. “Is that the new man? I mean the one
you were just talking to.”</p>

<p>“Yes. I met him at the gate. He had been up
to the house looking for me. His name is Crespo;
Carlos Crespo. He’s a Mexican. He tells me
he used to work for old Fereda. That he was
practically brought up on the estate.”</p>

<p>“Then he’s the very man we want!” exclaimed
Beatrice eagerly. “He’ll be able to tell us about
the Feredas.”</p>

<p>“I doubt your getting much information from
him,” returned Mr. Carroll. “He seems to be a
taciturn fellow. To tell you the truth, I wasn’t
very favorably impressed by him. He acted
sulky, it seemed to me. I’m going to give him a
trial, because it’s so hard to get a white man for
the job. I can’t afford to let this one slip without
giving him a chance. If I find him balky,
and ungracious to your aunt and you girls, I’ll
let him go. He says he knows nothing about
automobiles, but a great deal about horses.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, we don’t want him as chauffeur,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
anyway,” declared Patsy. “You and I can do all
the driving. He’ll be handy when we go on our
trip into the jungle. He can attend to the horses.
Very likely, when he gets used to us, he’ll be fairly
amiable. He can’t be any more snippy and disobliging
than John was last summer while we
were at Wilderness Lodge. He was positively
<em>hateful</em> to us. Of course, that was all on account
of his loyalty to that horrid Rupert Grandin. If
this Carlos man proves honest and dependable,
we sha’n’t mind if he sulks at first. He’ll probably
get over it as he comes to know us better.
We had an adventure this morning, Dad.”</p>

<p>Patsy straightway left the subject of the new
man and plunged into a colorful account of their
meeting with the strange old woman.</p>

<p>“Do you know who she is, Mr. Carroll? Did
you ever see her?” questioned Mabel eagerly.</p>

<p>“No.” Mr. Carroll shook his head. “She must
be the woman one of my colored boys was trying
to tell me about the other day. He described the
cottage you’ve just mentioned and said a ‘voodoo’
woman lived there who was ‘a heap sight
crazy.’ He claimed he saw her out in her yard
late one night ‘making spells.’ I didn’t pay much
attention to him, for these darkies are full of
superstitions and weird yarns.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>“We’ll ask Carlos about her,” decided Patsy.
“That makes two things we’re going to quiz him
about; the ‘voodoo’ lady and the Feredas. When
is he to begin working for you, Dad?”</p>

<p>“He’ll be back this afternoon. I’m going to
set him to work at clearing up the stable. It’s a
regular rubbish shack. I’ll give him a gang of
black boys to help him. I’m anxious to have
it put in trim as soon as possible. To-morrow
I must go over to the stock farm and see about
getting some horses for our use while here. I’ll
take Carlos with me and then we’ll see how much
he knows about horses.”</p>

<p>“We’d better be moving along. We promised
Miss Martha to be back in plenty of time for
luncheon,” reminded Mabel.</p>

<p>“I’ll see you girls at the house,” Mr. Carroll
said. “I’m going to take the car to the garage.
We’ll hardly need it this afternoon. The Wayfarers
are such famous hikers, they’ll scorn riding
to the beach,” he slyly added.</p>

<p>“Of course we are famous hikers. Certainly
we intend to walk to the beach,” sturdily concurred
Patsy.</p>

<p>“Scatter then, and give me the road,” playfully
ordered her father.</p>

<p>Moving briskly out of the way of the big machine,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
the chums followed it up the drive at a
leisurely pace.</p>

<p>“Well have to change our gowns before
luncheon.”</p>

<p>Eleanor ruefully inspected her crumpled white
linen skirt, plentifully stained with orange juice.</p>

<p>The others agreeing, they quickened their
pace and reaching the house hurriedly ascended
to their rooms to make the desired change. As
usual Mabel and Eleanor were rooming together.
Patsy and Bee shared a large airy room
next to that occupied by the two Perry girls.
Miss Martha roomed in lonely state in a huge,
high-ceilinged chamber across the corridor from
the rooms of her flock.</p>

<p>“I don’t care whether or not this Carlos man
acts sulky,” confided Patsy to Bee when the two
girls were by themselves in their own room. “I’m
going to beam on him like a real Cheshire cat.
He’ll be so impressed by my vast amiability that
he’ll be telling me all about the Feredas before
you can say Jack Robinson. I’m awfully interested
in this queer family and I simply must
satisfy my curiosity. Do you really believe, Bee,
that there <em>is</em> a mystery about them?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know whether there’s any mystery
about the Feredas themselves,” Bee said slowly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
“That old woman may or may not be crazy. I
was watching her closely all the time we stood
there. At first she was just suspicious of us as
being strangers. It was your saying that we
were living at Las Golondrinas and that your
father owned the property that made her so furious.
She had some strong reason of her own for
being so upset at hearing that.”</p>

<p>“Maybe she used to be a servant in the Fereda
family and on that account can’t bear to see
strangers living here in their place,” Patsy hazarded.</p>

<p>“I thought of that, too. It would account for
her tirade against Eulalie. I believe there’s more
to it than that, though, else why should she call
us thieves and go on as she did?”</p>

<p>Bee reflectively repeated the question she had
earlier propounded.</p>

<p>“That’s precisely what we are going to find
out,” Patsy said with determination.</p>

<p>“But you know what your aunt said,” Bee
dubiously reminded.</p>

<p>“Don’t you worry about Auntie,” smiled
Patsy. “When we tell her at luncheon about our
adventure she’ll probably say we had no business
to trespass. You let me do the talking. I
sha’n’t mention the word ‘mystery.’ I’ll just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
innocently ask her what she thinks the old witch
woman could have meant. She’ll be interested,
even if she pretends that she isn’t. Last summer,
at Wilderness Lodge, she was as anxious as we
for the missing will to be found. If there is truly
a mystery about Las Golondrinas, Aunt Martha
will soon be on the trail of it with the Wayfarers.
Take my word for it.”</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX<br />
<span class="smaller">THE WOOD NYMPH</span></h2>

<p>Invited by guileful Patsy at luncheon
that day to advance an opinion regarding
the “witch woman” of the morning’s adventure,
Miss Martha said precisely what her niece
had prophesied she would say. She added something,
however, which Patsy had not anticipated.</p>

<p>“You girls should have known better than trespass
on private property,” she rebuked. “As for
that woman, I should say she was mentally unbalanced.
Don’t any of you go near that cottage
again. I will not have you risking your lives in
the vicinity of a lunatic. You had best make
inquiry about her, Robert,” she continued, turning
to her brother.</p>

<p>“I intend to,” was the reply. “This new man,
Crespo, may know her history. Very likely she
is one of those queer but harmless characters that
one happens on occasionally down here. I hardly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
think there is any cause for alarm, Martha.
Still, it will be just as well for the girls to steer
clear of her.”</p>

<p>“I know I don’t want to go near her again,”
Mabel said with a slight shudder. “She was positively
savage.”</p>

<p>“One call is enough for me, thank you,” smiled
Eleanor.</p>

<p>Patsy and Beatrice exchanged significant
glances but said nothing. Each knew the other’s
thought. Both had a valiant hankering to try
their luck at a second interview with the witch
woman. Unfortunately for them, Miss Martha’s
stern mandate forbade further venturesome investigation.</p>

<p>Patsy’s carefully prepared question concerning
the strange old woman Miss Martha replied
to with a touch of impatience:</p>

<p>“My dear child, you can hardly expect me to
be able to find meaning in the ravings of a lunatic.
I have only one thing to say on the subject. I
have said it before and I repeat it. You are all
to keep away from that cottage.”</p>

<p>This emphatic repetition put a quietus to
Patsy’s hopes of awakening her aunt’s interest
in what she and Bee had already decided was a
real mystery. Miss Martha’s one thought on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
subject seemed to be that the society of an insane
woman should be shunned rather than courted.</p>

<p>“My little scheme turned out all wrong,” Patsy
admitted ruefully to Beatrice, as the two strolled
into the patio after luncheon and seated themselves
on the edge of the fountain’s time-worn
stone basin. “I wanted to go to that cottage
again, too.”</p>

<p>“So did I,” confessed Bee. “I was sure your
aunt would say we mustn’t.”</p>

<p>“I’m going to make Dad take us there some
day,” planned resourceful Patsy. “He’ll be willing
to, I know. Then Auntie can’t say a word.”</p>

<p>“Hey, there!” suddenly called a gay voice from
the balcony.</p>

<p>Both Bee and Patsy cast a quick glance upward
to see Mabel leaning over the balcony rail.</p>

<p>“Are we going to the beach, or not?” she inquired.
“If we are, you’d better leave off languishing
beside the fountain and hurry up. We
ought to start before sunset, you know,” she
added satirically.</p>

<p>“It’s only one-thirty by my little watch,”
calmly informed Patsy. “It’s a long time yet
until sunset, Mabsie. Didn’t you know that?”</p>

<p>“What about taking our bathing suits?” demanded
Mabel, ignoring Patsy’s playful thrust.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>“Just as you like. If you and Nellie want to
go bathing, then so do we.”</p>

<p>“I’d rather not,” returned Mabel. “I’d rather
just poke around down on the beach and in the
boat house. I think it would be more fun to get
up early to-morrow morning and go bathing.”</p>

<p>“Those are golden words, my child,” grinned
Patsy. “I was of the same mind, but too polite
to say so. We can prowl around the boat house
this afternoon and find out what we need to take
down there in the way of bathing comforts. Dad
says we’ll have to add the final touches ourselves.
We’ll be up in a minute, Mabsie.”</p>

<p>“All right.”</p>

<p>Mabel promptly disappeared from the balcony.
Patsy and Bee rose. Leaving the patio
they went upstairs to their room.</p>

<p>A few minutes later the Wayfarers and Mr.
Carroll were swinging down the oleander drive
toward the highway. Miss Martha had declined
to join the expedition. Following the highway
north for about an eighth of a mile, they turned
at last into a narrow white road hedged in by
vermilion hibiscus growing rank and wild for lack
of care. The road was shaded for some distance
by double rows of palms, which had been planted
on each side. Presently it entered the stretch of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
jungle lying above the beach and continued almost
straight ahead through the bit of wilderness.</p>

<p>“Some of the Feredas must have liked to go
bathing or they never would have had this dandy
road cut through to the beach,” was Beatrice’s
opinion, as the party came at last to the end of
the tropical road and out onto the warm white
sands.</p>

<p>The beach itself curved inward like a new
moon to meet the jungle which surrounded it on
three sides. At the left, near the water’s edge,
stood the once dilapidated boat house. It now
looked very trim in its new coat of white paint.</p>

<p>The jungle road ended almost at the middle
of the new moon. Emerging from it and walking
a few steps across the sands, the Wayfarers
paused, by common consent, to gaze admiringly
out on the glorious expanse of dazzlingly blue
sea that lay only the breadth of the curving
beach beyond them.</p>

<p>“This is the nicest bathing beach I ever saw!”
exclaimed Patsy. “The beauty of it is that it’s
our very own. We’re sole proprietors of this bit
of sand and sea.”</p>

<p>“It’s the first one <em>I</em> ever saw,” laughed Bee.
“You must remember that I never saw the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
Atlantic Ocean until I came down here. It seems
thrilling to be so near to it.”</p>

<p>“Wait until to-morrow morning and I’ll give
you a good salt-water ducking,” promised Patsy.
“Won’t that be nice and thrilling?”</p>

<p>“Try it if you dare,” challenged Bee, “and see
who gets the ducking.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry now that we didn’t bring our bathing
suits along,” lamented Eleanor. “I’d love
to have a swim in that nice blue water. It looks
fairly shallow, too.”</p>

<p>“At most of these lonely beaches along the
coast, I imagine the water must be too deep for
safety. This place looks safe enough,” agreed
Mabel enthusiastically.</p>

<p>“We can’t tell much about it until we try it
out for ourselves,” returned Patsy. “Sometimes
shallows stop all of a sudden and you get into
very deep water before you know it. I found
that out once when we were spending the summer
at Wildwood. Our cottage was quite a way up
the beach. I started to wade into the surf one
morning, and all at once I felt myself going
down, down, down. I had sense enough to strike
out and swim, or I wouldn’t be here now.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe the water is very deep here.”</p>

<p>Mr. Carroll now broke into the conversation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
He had been silently listening to his charges, an
amused smile touching his firm lips.</p>

<p>“You mustn’t venture too far out, though,”
he cautioned. “Remember, there are no guards
about to keep tabs on you. Besides, the mists
down here often creep up very suddenly over the
sea. If you happened to venture too far out and
were caught in one, your chance of regaining the
shore would be slim. I can’t always be depended
upon to be on hand to look out for you, so you’ll
have to be good children and not run any needless
risks.”</p>

<p>“We’ll be as good as gold and as careful as can
be,” lightly promised Patsy. “Now take us over
to the boat house. We’d like to see how it looks
inside.”</p>

<p>Conducted by Mr. Carroll to the trim little
house, the Wayfarers found it as completely
renovated inside as out. Mr. Carroll had gone
to considerable pains to transform the former
boat house into a comfortable bath house.
Wooden benches had been built along two sides
of it. Plenty of towel racks and hooks on which
to hang clothing were in evidence. A good-sized
mirror had been hung on one of the end walls.
There was also a tall rack designed to hold wet
bathing suits and numerous other minor details<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
had been added in the way of conveniences for
bathers.</p>

<p>“Why, it’s all ready for us!” exulted Patsy.
“You’ve thought of almost everything we’d need,
Dad. You’re a dear.”</p>

<p>“I had it fixed up as nearly like the one we had
at Wildwood as I could recall,” returned her
father. “You girls will have to add the finishing
touches. Sorry there isn’t a shower bath. I
intend to put one in later when I have time to
see to the piping for it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we can get along beautifully without it,”
Patsy assured. “It’s ever so much nicer than I
thought it would be. You’ve done wonders to get
it ready for us on such short notice.”</p>

<p>The other three girls were quick to concur with
Patsy in this opinion.</p>

<p>“Here’s the key.” Mr. Carroll handed it to his
daughter. “I now declare you Chief Custodian
of the Bath!”</p>

<p>“I accept the high office. May I be ever faithful
to my trust,” declaimed Patsy merrily as she
took the proffered key, a small brass affair on a
ring.</p>

<p>“The first thing we ought to do is to sit down
and make a list of the things we will have to bring
from the house,” suggested practical Beatrice.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
“I brought along a little memorandum pad and a
pencil.”</p>

<p>Extracting them from the breast pocket of her
white middy blouse, Bee offered them to Patsy.</p>

<p>“You may do the writing, Bee.” Patsy declined
the proffered pad and pencil. “I’ll tell you
what we’ll have to have. Any valuable suggestions
from the illustrious Perry sisters will be respectfully
received.”</p>

<p>“While this important consultation is in full
swing, I believe I’ll take a walk up the beach,”
announced Mr. Carroll. “My black boys tell me
there’s an old fisherman living not far above here
who owns several boats. I’m anxious to get in
touch with him and, if possible, arrange a fishing
trip for us while we’re here.”</p>

<p>“Go ahead, Dad. You have my permission,”
saucily replied Patsy. “After we’ve made our
list, we’ll lock up the bath house and play around
on the beach until you come back.”</p>

<p>The list having been finally completed, to the
Wayfarers’ mutual satisfaction, the quartette left
the bath house. Up and down the white stretch
of beach they strolled for a little, enjoying the
fresh sea breeze. Finally they seated themselves
on the warm sands to talk and watch the incoming
tide, interestedly trying to calculate how long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
it would be before they would have to move further
back to escape its slow but steady advance.</p>

<p>“It’s coming nearer and nearer,” remarked
Bee, as she fascinatedly watched the endless succession
of waves break on the sand, each a trifle
higher up the beach than the preceding one.</p>

<p>“I move that we move.”</p>

<p>Eleanor rose, shaking the sand from her white
linen skirt. Patsy and Beatrice also got to their
feet.</p>

<p>“I hate to move. I’m so comfy.”</p>

<p>Stretched at full length in the sand, Mabel
made no attempt to follow her companions’ example.</p>

<p>“Stay where you are then and get your feet
wet,” laughed Eleanor. “There’s a good-sized
wave heading straight for you now.”</p>

<p>This information caused Mabel hastily to draw
up her feet. Next moment she was standing
erect beside Eleanor.</p>

<p>“Dad ought to be back before long.”</p>

<p>Patsy stood gazing up the beach in the direction
Mr. Carroll had taken.</p>

<p>“Oh, look!”</p>

<p>The sudden ringing cry issued from Beatrice’s
lips. Her back to the sea, she had been dreamily
staring into the green depths of the jungle. Now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
she was pointing excitedly toward a tangled
thicket of briar bushes and flowering vines.</p>

<p>“Where? I don’t see anything! What is it,
Bee?” instantly went up from Mabel.</p>

<p>“She’s gone.” Bee’s arm dropped to her side.
“We scared her away. She ducked and ran.”</p>

<p>“Who ducked and ran? What are you talking
about, Bee?”</p>

<p>It was Patsy who now impatiently put these
questions.</p>

<p>“A wood nymph,” smiled Beatrice. “I was
looking at that thicket up there and all of a sudden
I saw her. She stood between two bushes
watching us. Such a pretty little thing, with big
black eyes and long black hair hanging about her
face. I had just caught a glimpse of her when I
called out to you. The minute she knew I’d seen
her she turned and ran off through the green. I
saw her black head bobbing in and out among
the bushes; then I lost sight of her.”</p>

<p>“You certainly saw more than we did,” Patsy
said ruefully. “I didn’t see anyone. Was she&mdash;well&mdash;a
white person, Bee?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes. As white as you or I, and about as
tall as Mab, I think,” replied Beatrice. “She had
a beautiful little face. She was wearing a faded
brown dress or apron. I couldn’t tell which. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
startled me to see her there, all of a sudden. She
looked so wild and shy and pretty. Exactly like
a wood nymph. I couldn’t help calling out.”</p>

<p>“Too bad we missed seeing her,” deplored
Eleanor. “Maybe we’ll run across her some other
day. She must live in this vicinity or she wouldn’t
have been roaming around in the jungle. She
certainly can’t be afraid of snakes. I wouldn’t
care to go dashing recklessly through that wilderness.”</p>

<p>“That’s only because you’re not used to the
idea,” declared Patsy. “By the time we’ve been
here a couple of weeks, we’ll probably go tramping
around in that bit of jungle without being in
the least afraid of snakes.”</p>

<p>“Never,” was Mabel’s discouraging ultimatum.</p>

<p>The appearance of Mr. Carroll some distance
up the beach diverted the minds of the quartette
from the shy little apparition Beatrice had seen.
With one accord the four set off on the run to
meet him.</p>

<p>Nor had the Wayfarers the remotest idea
that, from a concealing thicket of living green, a
few yards above the spot where they had been
standing, a pair of bright, black eyes wistfully
and wonderingly watched them as they scampered
across the sands toward Mr. Carroll.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X<br />
<span class="smaller">GETTING ACQUAINTED WITH OLD OCEAN</span></h2>

<p>“Isn’t there a road to this beach wide
enough for the automobile to run on?”
Miss Martha inquired of her brother at
breakfast the next morning, in a tone of long-suffering
patience.</p>

<p>“None that I know of,” was the discouraging
reply. “That stretch of jungle above the beach
extends for miles along the coast. The only road
to the sea in this vicinity is the one cut through
the woods by old Fereda. It’s hardly more than
a path. Too bad you don’t ride, Martha. You
could make it easily on horseback.”</p>

<p>“Never,” was the firm assertion. “I wouldn’t
trust myself to the best behaved horse that ever
lived. I suppose I shall have to resign myself to
walking.”</p>

<p>“You needn’t go with us, if you’d rather not,
Auntie,” broke in Patsy. “Dad says it’s perfectly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
safe for us to go alone. We’re on our own
property all the way to the beach, you know.”</p>

<p>“That is not the point,” calmly disagreed Miss
Carroll. “I feel it my duty to accompany you
whenever your father is unable to do so. I dare
say the sea breeze will benefit me. I merely dislike
the idea of this tramp through the brush and
weeds.”</p>

<p>“Oh, the road’s as smooth as can be,” hastily
assured Beatrice. “It’s only narrow, that’s all.
It’s really a beautiful walk, Miss Martha. I am
sure you will like it.”</p>

<p>“I doubt it,” was the pessimistic response.
“Nevertheless I shall go.”</p>

<p>Half an hour after breakfast a luggage-laden
procession set off beachwards. Miss Martha
brought up the rear with Mabel, eye-glasses
firmly astride her nose, a book in one hand, her
white parasol held over her head at a dignified
angle. Beatrice and Eleanor walked just ahead,
while Patsy buoyantly led the van, calling continually
back over her shoulder to her companions
with every fresh feature of interest her bright
eyes picked up along the way.</p>

<p>“I must say the walking is better than I had
expected to find it,” was Miss Carroll’s grudging
opinion as the party at length emerged from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
woods onto the sands. “Walking, as an exercise,
has never appealed to me, however.”</p>

<p>“If you walk down to the beach and back with
us every day, Auntie, you’ll soon become a champion
walker,” Patsy said lightly.</p>

<p>“I have no such ambition,” was her aunt’s dry
answer. “Further, I don’t intend to come down
here every day. On occasions when Robert is
busy, and I do not feel inclined to take this walk,
you will have to forego sea-bathing.”</p>

<p>“Come on over and see the bath house, Auntie.”</p>

<p>Patsy slipped an arm through that of her apparently
disobliging relative. She was well
aware of the fact that her aunt’s bark was worse
than her bite.</p>

<p>Escorted by Patsy to the little bath house, Miss
Martha critically inspected its interior and set
upon it her seal of placid approval. For a half
hour the four girls busied themselves with unpacking
and arranging the various articles they
had brought with them as final furnishing
touches. This done to their mutual satisfaction,
they gleefully began preparations for their
swim. In an incredibly short time they had
donned their bathing suits and were ready for
their morning dip.</p>

<p>“My first appearance as a deep sea swimmer,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
proudly announced Bee, making a low bow to
Patsy.</p>

<p>“You look sweet, Bee. That dark red suit is
awfully becoming,” praised Eleanor. “Pull your
cap down well over your head. Salt water makes
one’s hair so horrid and sticky.”</p>

<p>“Come on! The water’s fine! Hurrah for old
Ocean!”</p>

<p>Patsy held out an inviting hand to Beatrice.
Attired in a sleeveless suit of white flannel, with
pale blue trimmings, one auburn curl escaping
from under her white rubber cap, her gray eyes
dancing, cheeks pink with excitement, Patsy was
the embodiment of girlish prettiness and radiant
health.</p>

<p>The Wayfarers made a charming picture as
they caught hands and ran down the beach and
into the water four abreast. There was a pleasant
light in Miss Martha’s blue eyes as she stood
watching them and heard the concerted shout of
glee that arose as they struck the water and
Patsy immediately proceeded to administer the
ducking she had promised Beatrice.</p>

<p>Being a very sturdy young person, Bee had a
will of her own. In consequence a battle royal
ensued in the water, punctuated by shouts of
laughter. It ended by both combatants losing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
their footing and sitting down violently in the
water, to the great joy of Mabel and Eleanor,
who seized the opportunity to fall upon Patsy
and Bee and duck them thoroughly on their own
account. Whereupon a good-natured, free-for-all
combat waged.</p>

<p>Their first exuberance subsiding the bathers
settled themselves to enjoy their swim in the
buoyant salt water. Accustomed from childhood
to sea-bathing, Patsy was an expert swimmer.
Bee, who had learned to swim in fresh water, did
fairly well, however. Mabel and Eleanor were
indifferent swimmers. To quote Mabel: “We
can swim and that’s about all.”</p>

<p>Having watched her flock make a noisy acquaintance
with old Ocean, Miss Martha retired
to a spot on the sands shaded by the overhanging
palms where beach and jungle met. Seating herself
on the clean, warm sand, she opened the novel
she had brought with her and devoted herself to
its pages.</p>

<p>Oblivious for the time being to the merry voices
of her charges, she was finally startled by a piercing
shriek of pain. As a result of going bathing
bare-footed, one Wayfarer, at least, had met
with disaster. Eleanor had had the misfortune to
run afoul of a most ungracious crab, which had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
promptly shown displeasure of the intrusion by
taking hold and pinching.</p>

<p>By the time Miss Martha had dropped parasol
and book to rush to the water’s edge, Eleanor had
won free of her tormentor and was limping for
land.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, Eleanor?” Miss Carroll
cried out concernedly.</p>

<p>“A horrid crab pinched my foot,” was the
doleful response. “I thought it would never let
go. I was wading near the shore and stepped
on it. My, but my foot hurts!”</p>

<p>Emerging from the shallows, Eleanor dropped
down on the sand and began tenderly nursing her
injured foot.</p>

<p>“You should have worn bathing slippers and
stockings,” was the doubtful consolation. “They
not only look well but are also a protection.”</p>

<p>“But this is a private beach and it’s ever so
much more fun not to wear them, Miss Martha.
I’m not really hurt much. My foot feels all right
now,” Eleanor hastily assured. “It hardly pains
me at all.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I sha’n’t insist on your wearing them,”
Miss Martha smiled grimly at Eleanor’s miraculous
recovery. “I merely expressed my opinion.”</p>

<p>By this time, Mabel, who had been some distance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
away from her sister when the latter cried
out, now appeared beside her.</p>

<p>“What happened to you, Nellie?” she asked.
“I heard you yell and came as fast as I could.”</p>

<p>“Oh, a hateful old crab pinched my foot. It
wasn’t anything. I was silly to make a fuss about
it. I frightened Miss Martha and I’ve spoiled
Bee’s and Patsy’s sport. They’d started to race
as far as that upper curve of the beach. Now
they’re coming back.”</p>

<p>“It’s just as well.” Miss Martha consulted
her wrist watch. “You girls have been in the
water over an hour. That is long enough for
your first day’s bathing.”</p>

<p>Patsy and Bee presently arriving on the scene
with solicitous inquiries, they were promptly informed
of Eleanor’s mishap by the sufferer herself.</p>

<p>“Poor ’ittle Nellie! Did a nasty, naughty old
crab nip her tootsey-ootsey?” deplored Patsy.
“Show Patsy that wicked crabby an’ her’ll kill
him wight down dead.”</p>

<p>“Oh, stop, you goose,” giggled Eleanor.
“You make me feel as though I were about three
years old.”</p>

<p>“That’s the way she appreciates my sympathy,”
grinned Patsy. “Never mind, Nellie. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
forgive you, even if you did interrupt the grand
race. Bee was gaining on me, anyway. She
might possibly have beaten me. Want to try it
over again, Bee?”</p>

<p>“Not to-day, Patsy,” objected her aunt.
“You’ve been in the water long enough. By the
time you girls are ready to go back to the house
it will be nearly noon. I ordered luncheon at one
o’clock, as usual. It will be one before we reach
the house.”</p>

<p>“All right, Auntie. We’ll postpone the great
race until to-morrow.”</p>

<p>As she spoke, Patsy began energetically to
wring the salt water from the skirt of her bathing
suit, preparatory to retiring into the bath
house.</p>

<p>Her companions following Patsy’s example,
Miss Carroll strolled back to the spot where she
had left book and parasol. The white parasol lay
precisely where she had cast it aside in her hurried
dash to Eleanor’s rescue. The book&mdash;&mdash;Miss
Martha stared down at the sand in sheer amazement.
The red, cloth-bound volume she had been
reading had disappeared as utterly as though the
earth had suddenly opened and swallowed it.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI<br />
<span class="smaller">A TIMID CALLER</span></h2>

<p>“My book! Where is it?”</p>

<p>Miss Martha continued to stare
severely at the spot where her book
had so lately lain.</p>

<p>“I saw you sitting there reading it,” affirmed
Eleanor positively. “I remember looking up
toward you just before that cranky old crab
nipped my foot.”</p>

<p>“Certainly I was reading it. I laid it down
beside my parasol. It never walked away by itself.
Someone stole it. This is very unpleasant.
I don’t like it at all. It simply goes to show that
I was right in not allowing you girls to come
down here alone. Some unknown person has
evidently been hidden back there in those woods
watching us.”</p>

<p>Miss Martha shook a dramatic finger toward
the jungle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh!” Bee gave a quick, startled gasp. “I
wonder&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“What is it, Beatrice? Tell me instantly,”
commanded Miss Carroll.</p>

<p>“Why&mdash;nothing&mdash;only&mdash;&mdash;” Bee hesitated.
“Yesterday when we were down here,” she continued,
“I saw a&mdash;a young girl standing back in
a thicket watching us. She might be the
one&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“She might indeed,” grimly concurred Miss
Martha. “I haven’t the least doubt but that she
appropriated it. I have been told that the negroes
down here are a thieving lot. Strange she
didn’t take my parasol.”</p>

<p>“But this girl I saw was as white as Patsy or
I,” protested Bee. “She was so pretty. I don’t
believe&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I would far rather lay the loss of my book
to her than to some prowling tramp,” retorted
Miss Martha.</p>

<p>“A person who would take an ordinary cloth-bound
book and not an expensive white silk parasol
can’t be a very desperate character,” surmised
Patsy gaily. “I guess there’s really nothing
to worry about. Perhaps this wood nymph
of Bee’s is fond of reading.”</p>

<p>“I am not inclined to pass over the incident<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
so lightly,” disagreed her aunt. “I shall insist on
Robert’s finding out who this girl is and all about
her.”</p>

<p>Some further discussion of the affair ensued
during which Miss Carroll again repeated her
stern injunction: “You must never come down
here to bathe unless either my brother or I are
with you. It strikes me that this community is
entirely too full of thieves and lunatics for comfort.”</p>

<p>“I’m pretty sure that it was our wood nymph
who made off with Aunt Martha’s book,” confided
Patsy to Bee as they finally started for the
bath house. “I have a scheme of my own that
I’m going to carry out. If it works&mdash;well, just
watch me to-morrow and see. I’m not going to
tell you about it now, so don’t ask me.”</p>

<p>“All right, keep it to yourself. I’d rather
not hear it, anyway,” amiably responded Bee.
“It will be more fun just to watch your mysterious
movements and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Bee,” interrupted Patsy, “things <em>are</em> really a
little mysterious, aren’t they? First we run across
that queer, terrible old woman who talks in riddles
about Eulalie and Camillo and our being
thieves, etc. Then you see a wood nymph, and
next day Auntie’s book vanishes into thin air.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
We simply must find someone who can tell us
something about who’s who at Las Golondrinas.
The minute I get back to the house I’m going to
hunt up Dad’s new man, Carlos, and quiz him.
He must certainly know a little about things
around here.”</p>

<p>It being after one o’clock when the party returned
to the house, luncheon immediately
claimed Patsy’s attention. Inquiry of her father
as to where she might find Carlos resulted in the
disappointing information that he had ridden out
to the stock farm early that morning and would
not return until late in the evening.</p>

<p>Mr. Carroll appeared somewhat concerned
over his sister’s account of the sudden disappearance
of her book. Informed of the young
girl Beatrice had spied watching the Wayfarers
from the bushes on the previous day, a light of
sudden recollection leaped into his eyes.</p>

<p>“Was the girl you saw a black-eyed, elfish-looking
youngster with long black hair hanging
about her face?” he asked Beatrice.</p>

<p>“Yes,” nodded Beatrice. “You must have
seen her, too,” she added with quick interest.</p>

<p>“Where did you see her, Dad?” demanded
Patsy excitedly.</p>

<p>“Uncle Jemmy and I surprised her the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
day in the orange grove nearest to the lower end
of the estate. She was sitting under a palmetto
tree, singing to herself. She had a wreath of
white flowers on her head and looked for all the
world like a mischievous wood sprite.” Mr. Carroll
smiled reminiscently. “The moment she
caught sight of us she jumped up from the
ground and was off like the wind through the
grove. I haven’t the least idea where she went.
I asked old Jemmy about her, but he’d never
seen her before. He’s not familiar with this part
of the country, you know.”</p>

<p>“As I remarked this morning to the girls, there
seem to be altogether too many queer persons
in this vicinity for comfort,” Miss Martha commented
in a displeased tone. “Have you made
inquiry yet, Robert, of your new man regarding
that demented old woman?”</p>

<p>“No; I forgot all about her,” Mr. Carroll admitted
rather sheepishly. “I’ll make it a point to
do so to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“You might inquire about this girl at the same
time,” pursued his sister. “It is very necessary
that we should know exactly who these persons
are and what we may expect from them.”</p>

<p>“This little girl may be the daughter of one of
the fishermen. There are a few families of fisher-folk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
living in shacks farther up the beach. I
noticed half a dozen bare-footed youngsters playing
on the sands when I called on old Nathan,
the fisherman, yesterday.”</p>

<p>“It is unfortunate that this property of yours
happens to be so isolated,” deplored Miss Carroll.
“Our only neighbors are, apparently, fisher-folk,
one lunatic and a few negroes.”</p>

<p>“Never mind, Auntie. The Wayfarers are
sufficient unto themselves,” consoled Patsy. “We
can get along beautifully without neighbors.”</p>

<p>“If you feel uneasy about staying here, Martha,
then I’ll make arrangements for you and
the girls at one of the Beach hotels,” offered Mr.
Carroll solicitously.</p>

<p>“I’m not in the least uneasy,” calmly assured
Miss Martha. “I rather enjoy the novelty of this
old place. Certainly I would not care to leave it
now, since you have gone to so much trouble to
get it ready for us. I merely wish to be sure
that we shall not be annoyed by irresponsible or
dangerous characters. The very fact that we
have no near neighbors of our own class makes
it necessary for us to protect ourselves against
unpleasant intruders.”</p>

<p>The Wayfarers had awaited Miss Carroll’s
reply to her brother’s offer with bated breath.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
When it came, each girlish face expressed unmistakable
relief. The charm of Las Golondrinas
had taken hold of them. Patsy, in particular, felt
that to be torn away from it now and returned to
the artificiality of hotel life would be a cross
indeed. She was anxious to discover if the old
house really held a mystery.</p>

<p>“I hardly believe you will be,” responded Mr.
Carroll. “A few days and I shall have my affairs
arranged so as to be with you on most of your
jaunts. Then we shall be able to find out a good
deal more about Las Golondrinas and its environments
than I’ve had time, thus far, to look into.”</p>

<p>“I hope so, I’m sure,” Miss Martha replied
in a tone which implied anything but hope.</p>

<p>“How would you like to drive to Palm Beach
this afternoon, stop at the Cocoanut Grove for
tea and later take dinner at one of the hotels?”
proposed Mr. Carroll, with diplomatic intent to
change the subject.</p>

<p>This proposal met with instant enthusiastic
response from the girls. Even Miss Carroll graciously
admitted that it would be pleasant.</p>

<p>Luncheon over, the Wayfarers promptly scurried
upstairs to decide the momentous questions
of gowns. To go to Palm Beach merely for an
afternoon and evening’s outing was an entirely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
different matter from going there for the remainder
of their vacation. Tea in the Cocoanut Grove
promised to be interesting.</p>

<p>When, at three o’clock that afternoon, the
automobile sped down the oleander drive laden
with its freight of daintily gowned girls, Miss
Martha’s equanimity had quite returned. Seated
in the tonneau between Mabel and Eleanor, she
looked very stately and imposing in a smart frock
of heavy wistaria silk, a plumed hat to match
setting off to perfection her thick snowy hair and
patrician features.</p>

<p>Bee was wearing her best gown, a becoming
affair of pale pink taffeta which had been fashioned
by her mother’s clever fingers. Mabel had
chosen a dainty little dress of pale green jersey
silk, embroidered with white daisies. Eleanor
wore a fluffy blue chiffon creation, while Patsy
was radiantly pretty in white net over white
taffeta.</p>

<p>That the Wayfarers presented a charming appearance
in their delicately-hued finery at least
one spectator to their departure could testify. As
the car swept through the gateway and onto the
white public road, from behind a flower-laden
bush situated just inside the gates, a black-haired,
bare-footed girl emerged and peered wistfully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
through the iron palings after the fast vanishing
automobile.</p>

<p>When it had entirely disappeared from view,
the elfish little watcher turned and threw herself
face downward in the tangled grass and began a
low disconsolate wailing, her thin shoulders shaking
with convulsive sobs. There she continued to
lie, beating the long grass with two small brown
clenched hands.</p>

<p>Her emotion having finally spent itself she
slowly dragged herself to her feet, tossed her long
heavy black hair out of her eyes, and sped like a
fawn across the lawn. Coming at last to a clump
of low growing bushes, she dived in under them
and reappeared, holding something in her hand.
Then she was off again, this time toward the
house. Slipping through the oleander hedge with
the ease of a wood sprite, she made final port at
the entrance to the patio.</p>

<p>The doors stood open. Like a shadow she
flitted through the doorway and into the patio
beyond. On a rustic seat near the fountain, she
laid the object which she carried in one thin
brown hand. Then she turned and ran in the
direction from which she had come like a timid,
hunted young animal.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII<br />
<span class="smaller">INTERVIEWING CARLOS</span></h2>

<p>Strolling into the patio with Eleanor
next morning, Miss Martha Carroll was
treated to a surprise. Passing one of the
rustic seats set at intervals about the patio, her
eyes chanced to come to rest on an astonishingly
familiar object. It was nothing more nor less
than a fat, red-covered volume lying on the seat
before which she had paused in sheer amazement.</p>

<p>“Why&mdash;where&mdash;&mdash;” she stammered, adjusting
her eye-glasses and staring hard at the gilt-lettered
title, “The Interrupted Quest,” which conspicuously
adorned the book’s front cover.</p>

<p>“This is really amazing!” she exclaimed, addressing
Eleanor, who had halted beside her.</p>

<p>“What is it, Miss Martha?”</p>

<p>Eleanor looked wonderingly curious. She had
not the remotest idea of the cause of Miss Martha’s
agitation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>“<em>This</em> is the book that disappeared from the
beach yesterday morning,” emphasized Miss Carroll.
“<em>How</em>, I should like to know, does it happen
to be here?”</p>

<p>“Why!” Eleanor’s blue eyes grew round with
surprise. “That’s queer, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Too queer by far,” was the displeased answer.</p>

<p>“Oh, look!”</p>

<p>Eleanor had picked up the book from the seat.
As she raised it, a slip of paper fluttered to the
stone floor of the patio. Stooping, she gathered
it in. Written on it in pencil was the single word:
“Gracias.”</p>

<p>“It’s meant for ‘gracious,’ I guess,” puzzled
Eleanor, “only it isn’t spelled correctly. I really
believe it must have been that queer girl Bee saw
who took the book. She’s honest, at least. She
returned it. But why in the world did she write
‘gracious’ on that slip of paper? Here come the
girls. May I tell them, Miss Martha?”</p>

<p>“Of course.”</p>

<p>Miss Carroll had seated herself on the bench, a
decided frown between her brows. She did not
in the least relish this latest performance on the
part of the elflike stranger. The unexpected
return of the book indicated that the odd little
prowler was evidently, as Eleanor said, honest.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
Yet the fact remained that she <em>was</em> a prowler,
which annoyed Miss Martha considerably.</p>

<p>“The lost is found!” Eleanor called triumphantly
across the patio to the approaching trio
of girls. “What do you think of this?”</p>

<p>She held up the book for them to see.</p>

<p>“Why, it <em>is</em> Auntie’s lost book, isn’t it? Where
did it come from, Nellie?”</p>

<p>Patsy’s face registered a mystified surprise
which was also reflected on the features of her
companions.</p>

<p>“We found it lying on that seat,” explained
Eleanor. “This slip of paper was tucked into
it.”</p>

<p>Patsy took the bit of paper which Eleanor
proffered. Mabel and Bee eagerly peered at it
over her shoulder as she held it up and inspected
the one word written on it. Her brows contracted
in a puzzled frown.</p>

<p>“Humph!” she ejaculated. “I don’t see&mdash;-”</p>

<p>“I do,” interrupted Mabel with a little laugh.
“That word ‘gracias’ is Spanish for ‘thank you.’”</p>

<p>“Then my wood nymph is <em>Spanish</em>!” Bee cried
out. “It was she who took the book. The whole
thing is as plain as daylight. She only borrowed
it over night to <em>read</em>. Miss Martha’s pretty white
parasol didn’t interest her at all. It was the book<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
that took her eye. And why? Because she
wanted to read it, of course.”</p>

<p>“Go ahead, Sherlock,” teased Patsy. “What
next?”</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;&mdash;” Bee laughed and looked slightly
confused. “We know, too, that she is honest,
or&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“That’s just what I said,” interposed Eleanor.</p>

<p>“Really, Beatrice, I can hardly imagine a wild-looking
girl such as you have described as having
literary tastes,” broke in Miss Martha drily. “It
is far more reasonable to assume that the bright
color of my book caught her eye. She may have
thought it a picture book. Finding out that it
was not, some strange impulse of her own caused
her to return it. Her methods seem to me decidedly
primitive. Why doesn’t she come out and
show herself openly, instead of dodging about
under cover like a young savage?”</p>

<p>“She is probably just awfully shy,” staunchly
defended Patsy. “She can’t really be quite a savage.
She wrote ‘thank you’ on that bit of paper.
That proves two things. She knows how to
write and is not too ignorant to be polite.”</p>

<p>“I don’t consider prowling about in the bushes
and spying upon strangers marked indications of
politeness,” was Miss Carroll’s satirical return.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
“I can’t say I relish the prospect of having this
young imp bob up at us unexpectedly at every
turn we make.”</p>

<p>The Wayfarers giggled in unison at this remark.
Miss Martha did not resent their mirth.
She even smiled a little herself, a fact which Patsy
shrewdly noted. It informed her that her aunt
was not seriously prejudiced against the will-o’-the-wisp
little stranger. Like everything else at
Las Golondrinas, this new feature of mystery
made strong appeal to Patsy. She was inwardly
resolved eventually to hunt down the elusive,
black-eyed sprite and make her acquaintance.</p>

<p>With this idea in mind she now made energetic
announcement:</p>

<p>“I’m going to interview Carlos this minute and
learn a few things about the natives. Anybody
who wants to come along has my gracious permission.
If nobody wants to, then I’m going just
the same. He’s down at the stable this morning.
Dad said so.”</p>

<p>“I’ll go,” accepted Bee. “I have almost as
much curiosity as you.”</p>

<p>“I don’t feel like going out in the hot sun,”
Eleanor said. “It’s so nice and cool here in the
patio. I have no curiosity.”</p>

<p>“You mean energy,” corrected Bee.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>“I have neither,” beamed Eleanor, “so just run
along without me. You can tell me all about
what Carlos said when you come back. I’ll be
right here waiting for you.”</p>

<p>“You may wait a long while,” jeered Mabel.
“I’m not so lazy as you. I’m going with the
girls and practice my Spanish on Carlos.”</p>

<p>“I hope he’ll survive it,” retaliated Eleanor.</p>

<p>“You should worry. <i lang="es">Adios.</i>”</p>

<p>Mabel waved a derisive farewell to her sister
as she turned to follow Patsy and Bee, who had
already started for the main exit to the patio,
which opened onto the driveway.</p>

<p>Arm in arm, the trio followed the drive, coming
at last to the stable, a rambling stone structure
situated at some distance below the house.</p>

<p>“There’s Carlos now! He looks like a cowboy,
doesn’t he?”</p>

<p>Patsy had spied her father’s new man standing
in front of the stable engaged in lighting a
cigarette. Attired in an open-necked flannel
shirt, brown corduroy trousers and a weather-stained
sombrero, the Mexican presented a rather
picturesque appearance, or so the Wayfarers
thought.</p>

<p>Immediately he caught sight of the three girls,
the man’s dark features grew lowering. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
made a move as though to enter the stable door,
then stood still, regarding his advancing visitors
with sullen indifference.</p>

<p>“You speak to him, Mab,” urged Patsy in an
undertone. “Say something to him in Spanish.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I can’t,” demurred Mabel. “What shall
I say?”</p>

<p>“Say ‘good-day’ in Spanish,” prompted Patsy.
“Go ahead.”</p>

<p>Raising her voice, Mabel called out politely:
“<i lang="es">Buenos dias, señor.</i>”</p>

<p>The man made no effort to doff his sombrero
in response to this hail. Neither did he leave off
smoking his cigarette.</p>

<p>“I spik English,” he announced in a sulky tone
that suggested affront rather than appreciation
of being thus addressed in his native tongue.</p>

<p>“So much the better for us then.”</p>

<p>Patsy now became spokesman. There was a
gleam of lively resentment in her gray eyes, born
of the man’s ungracious behavior.</p>

<p>For an instant the two regarded each other
steadily. Something in the girl’s resolute, unflinching
gaze caused the man’s small black eyes
to waver. He glimpsed in that direct glance the
same determined will he had already discovered
the “Señor Carroll” possessed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>As if unwillingly impelled to break the silence
he mumbled sulkily: “What do you desire?”</p>

<p>“To ask you a few questions,” tersely returned
Patsy. “My father tells me that you used to
work for Mr. Fereda, the old Spanish gentleman
who once owned this estate. So you must know
something of the Feredas, and also of the few
persons who live in this vicinity.”</p>

<p>Patsy’s former intent to be affable had completely
vanished. Decidedly miffed by the man’s
too evident surliness, she spoke almost imperiously.</p>

<p>“Las Golondrinas covers much ground. I
know a little; not much,” was the evasive answer.</p>

<p>“I am sure you must know something of the
queer old woman who lives in a little cottage outside
the estate, and just beyond the orange
groves,” Patsy coolly challenged. “Who is she
and how long has she lived there?”</p>

<p>“Ah, yes, I know.”</p>

<p>Carlos blew a cloud of cigarette smoke into
the air and indifferently watched it drift away.</p>

<p>“She is Rosita,” he shrugged. “Always she
has lived there. As children she and old Manuel
played together. Her father was the servant of
his father, Enrico Fereda. Rosita is the widow
for many years.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>Three pairs of alert ears avidly picked up the
name “Enrico.” Here it seemed was still another
member of the Fereda family.</p>

<p>“Is she crazy?”</p>

<p>It was Mabel who now tactlessly interposed
with this blunt question.</p>

<p>It had an electrical effect upon Carlos. His
attitude of bored indifference left him. His lax
shoulders straightened with an angry jerk. His
black eyes narrowed in sinister fashion.</p>

<p>“You spik of my grandmother, <i lang="es">señorita</i>!” he
rebuked, drawing himself up with an air of offended
dignity.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon,” Mabel said hastily, her
color rising.</p>

<p>In spite of her embarrassment she was seized
with an irresistible desire to laugh. Realizing
that laughter was imminent, she turned to Patsy
with: “I’m going back to the house. I’ll see
you later,” and ingloriously retired from the
scene, leaving Patsy and Bee to conduct the remainder
of the interview.</p>

<p>“Why the <i lang="es">señorita</i> so spik of my grandmother?
You have seen her?”</p>

<p>Carlos threw away his cigarette and appeared
for the first time to take an interest in things.
Bee thought she detected a faint note of concern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
in his voice. She had been watching him closely
and had already decided that he knew a great
deal more about Las Golondrinas and its environments
than he pretended to know.</p>

<p>“We saw your grandmother’s cottage the
other day from the orange groves. We walked
over to it. Your grandmother came out of the
cottage and asked us who we were. When we
told her and tried to ask her some questions about
the Fereda family, she screamed and raved at us
and ordered us to go away and not come back.
She behaved and talked very much like a crazy
person.”</p>

<p>It was Bee who purposely made this somewhat
full explanation. She had a curious conviction
that her recital of old Rosita’s wild outburst
was a piece of news to Carlos, and that it
did not please him.</p>

<p>“Rosita is not <i lang="es">loco</i>,” Carlos shook his head in
sullen contradiction. “What you want know
’bout the family de Fereda? Why you want
know?”</p>

<p>As Patsy’s original intention had been to quiz
Carlos about the Feredas, she now hailed the opportunity.
The identity of Rosita having been
established and her sanity vouched for by her
grandson, at least, Patsy was eager to go on to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
the Feredas themselves. Carlos appeared, too, to
be thawing out a trifle. She had, at least, aroused
his curiosity.</p>

<p>“We would like to know the history of the
Feredas because we think it would be interesting.
We know by the portraits in the picture gallery
that they were a very old family,” she began
eagerly. “Do you know anything about those
portraits? Have you ever been in the gallery?”</p>

<p>“I have been; remember nothing,” was the discouraging
response. “Of the history this family
know nothing.”</p>

<p>Carlos’ face had resumed its mask of indifference.
Only his black eyes held a curiously alert
expression which watchful Bee did not fail to
note.</p>

<p>Patsy looked her disappointment. She had
hoped to extract from Carlos some information
not only about the Feredas but also concerning
the portrait which so greatly interested her.
Failing, she next bethought herself of the mysterious
wood nymph.</p>

<p>“The other day my father saw a pretty young
girl with black eyes and long black hair in our
orange groves,” she began afresh. “My friend,
Miss Forbes,” Patsy indicated Bee, “also saw her
in the woods near our bathing beach. Can you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
tell me who she is? She certainly must live not
far from here.”</p>

<p>A swift flash of anger flitted across the Mexican’s
face. It was gone almost instantly.</p>

<p>“I have not seen,” he denied. “Now I go. I
have the work to do.”</p>

<p>Wheeling abruptly he started off across the
grass, almost on the run, and was soon lost to
view among the trees.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII<br />
<span class="smaller">TWO LETTERS</span></h2>

<p>“Did you ever try to talk to a more aggravating
person?” Patsy cried out
vexedly to Bee. “Does he know anything,
or doesn’t he?”</p>

<p>“He knows a good deal, but he won’t tell it,”
returned Bee shrewdly. “For one thing he
knows who our wood nymph is. He looked awfully
black when you mentioned her. I wonder
why?”</p>

<p>“She may be a relative,” surmised Patsy.
“She’s Spanish or Mexican, I’m sure.”</p>

<p>“I hadn’t thought of that. You’re a better
deducer than I,” laughed Bee.</p>

<p>“Thank you, thank you!” Patsy bowed exaggerated
gratitude.</p>

<p>“If this Rosita is really Carlos’ grandmother,
as he says she is, she certainly never told him
about our going to the cottage that day,” declared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
Beatrice. “He pretended to be indifferent,
but he was surprised. I read it in his eyes.
Now why didn’t she tell him?”</p>

<p>“I give it up. I give the whole thing up.
Every time we try to find out anything about
these Feredas we bump up against a lot of questions
that we can’t answer,” sighed Patsy. “We
might better forget the whole thing and just
enjoy ourselves.”</p>

<p>“Let’s go back to the house,” proposed Beatrice,
“and tell that faithless Mab what we think
of her for beating it off in such a hurry.”</p>

<p>“She knew she was going to laugh. I could
hardly keep my face straight. Carlos straightened
up and looked so injured. I don’t see,
though, why he should call his grandmother
Rosita. I never called <em>my</em> grandmother, Priscilla,
I’m sure, even in my ignorant infancy,”
giggled Patsy.</p>

<p>“It would have sounded rather disrespectful,”
agreed Bee, echoing the giggle. “I can’t say
much for Carlos’ manners. He never raised his
hat to us at all, but stood there and blew smoke
right in our faces.”</p>

<p>“Dad would be awfully cross if he knew that.
I’m not going to tell him. He’s had so much
trouble hiring a man for this place. He’d go to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
Carlos and reprimand him and Carlos would
leave and&mdash;&mdash;Oh, what’s the use? We won’t
bother with Carlos again, anyway. He’d never
tell us anything. I’m going to write a letter to-day
to Eulalie Fereda and have Mr. Haynes, the
agent, forward it. I simply must learn the history
of that dark, wicked-looking cavalier in the
picture gallery. Of course she may not answer
it, but then, she may. It’s worth trying, anyway.”</p>

<p>Entering the patio and finding it deserted, Bee
and Patsy passed through it and on up stairs in
search of Mabel. They finally found her in the
big, somber sitting room, engaged in her favorite
occupation of hunting for the secret drawer which
she stoutly insisted the quaint walnut desk contained.
This idea having become firmly fixed in
her mind she derived signal amusement in searching
for the mythical secret drawer.</p>

<p>“Is she crazy?” jeered Patsy, pointing to
Mabel, who was kneeling before the massive piece
of furniture, her exploring fingers carefully going
over every inch of the elaborately carved
solid front of the desk.</p>

<p>“Oh, so you’ve come back!” Mabel sprang to
her feet, laughing. “I had to run away,” she
apologized. “I felt so silly. I didn’t want to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
laugh in his very face. How was I to know that
the witch woman was Carlos’ grandmother? Did
you find out anything?”</p>

<p>“No.” Bee shook her head. “Carlos will never
set the world on fire as an information bureau.
According to his own statements, he sees nothing,
knows nothing and remembers nothing. He is a
positive clam!”</p>

<p>“I’m going to write to Eulalie <em>now</em>, while it’s
on my mind,” announced Patsy. “Bee, you may
play around with Mab while I’m writing. You
may both hunt for the secret drawer. When I
finish my letter, I’ll read it to you. Then I’m going
to write another. When that’s done we are
all going down to the beach. A great scheme is
seething in my fertile brain. Where’s Nellie?”</p>

<p>“In our room, overhauling her trunk,” informed
Mabel. “We can’t go to the beach without
Miss Martha, and she said she wouldn’t go
to-day.”</p>

<p>“Leave that to me,” retorted Patsy. “I know
what I’m doing, even if you don’t.”</p>

<p>For the next half-hour, comparative quiet
reigned in the big room, broken only by an occasional
remark or giggle from Bee and Mabel as
they pursued their fruitless search.</p>

<p>“There!” cried Patsy at last as she signed her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
name to the letter she had just finished writing.</p>

<p>“Listen to this:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">“‘<span class="smcap">Dear Miss Fereda</span>:</p>

<p>“‘I have heard of you from Mr. Haynes, the
agent, from whom my father, Robert Carroll,
purchased Las Golondrinas. My aunt, my father,
three of my friends and myself are at present
spending a few weeks’ vacation at Las Golondrinas.
We are greatly interested in the portrait
gallery and should appreciate it if you would tell
us something of the large portrait of the
Spanish cavalier which hangs in the center of the
gallery. He is a most romantic-looking person
and must surely have an interesting history. We
are very curious about him.</p>

<p>“‘We have wondered that you did not reserve
the collection of family portraits before selling
the estate. If you would like to have them they
are at your disposal. My father and I both feel
that you have first right to them.</p>

<p>“‘Las Golondrinas is an ideal place in which
to spend a vacation. We are quite in love with
this quaint old house and its furnishings. Would
you object to telling us when the house was built
and how many generations of Feredas have lived
in it? Judging from the many antiques it contained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
and its general plan, it must be very old
indeed.</p>

<p>“‘We are sorry not to have met you personally
and hope some day to have that pleasure. I
understand that you are a young girl of about
my own age. No doubt we should find that we
had many interests in common. It would be a
pleasure to have you visit me while we are here
and meet my father, my aunt and my friends.
Could you not arrange to pay us a visit?</p>

<p>“‘I shall hope to hear from you and that we
may become better acquainted in the near future.</p>

<p class="center">“‘Yours sincerely,</p>

<p class="right">“‘<span class="smcap">Patricia Carroll</span>.’</p>

</div>

<p>“How is that for a nice, polite letter to Eulalie?”
Patsy inquired. “Any criticisms? If so,
out with them now. If not, into an envelope it
goes and on its way to the last of the Feredas,
wherever she may happen to be. I’m not really
counting much on an answer. I haven’t the least
idea in the world what sort of girl this Eulalie is.
Anyway it will do no harm to write her. If she
should answer and we became acquainted and she
paid us a visit, it would be splendid.”</p>

<p>“I think it’s a nice letter,” praised Mabel.
“Go ahead and send it, Patsy.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>“I am sure she’ll like it,” approved Bee. “It’s
thoughtful in your father to offer her the collection
of portraits.”</p>

<p>“It seems funny to me that she didn’t reserve
them. Maybe she didn’t want them. She might
have grown tired of seeing them every day for so
many years,” speculated Mabel. “They aren’t a
particularly cheerful-looking lot of ladies and
gentlemen. They all look so cold and stern and
tragic.”</p>

<p>“Auntie says they gave her the horrors,”
chuckled Patsy. “When I told her that Dad said
I could write to Eulalie and ask her if she wanted
the collection, Auntie said: ‘A very sensible idea.
She is welcome to them. If she doesn’t want
them I shall have the gallery cleared out before
we come down here next season.”</p>

<p>“If Eulalie doesn’t want them, what will become
of them?” Bee asked thoughtfully. “Would
your father sell them? Suppose you were to find
that some of them had been painted by famous
artists? Then they’d be very valuable.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what Dad would do in that case.
He spoke of having an art collector come down
here and look them over, you know. Of course,
if Eulalie sends for them, that’s the end of it.
If she doesn’t, Auntie will have them taken down.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
I know one thing. She hates the sight of them.
Now I must write another letter. I hope I sha’n’t
be disturbed while I’m writing it.”</p>

<p>Patsy beamed on her chums with owlish significance.</p>

<p>“Isn’t she snippy?” sniffed Mabel. “Come on,
Bee, we’ve got to find that secret drawer. I hope
we sha’n’t be disturbed while we’re hunting for
it.”</p>

<p>Patsy merely grinned amiably at this thrust
and settled herself to the writing of her letter.
A little smile curved her red lips as the pen fled
over the paper.</p>

<p>For ten minutes she continued to write, then
called out:</p>

<p>“Come here, children, and sign this letter.”</p>

<p>“Never put your signature to a paper until you
know what it’s all about,” Bee warned Mabel.</p>

<p>“Oh, you needn’t be so cautious. I was going
to let you see what I wrote. Here!”</p>

<p>Patsy handed the letter to Bee.</p>

<p>Heads together, Mabel and Bee proceeded to
read that which made them smile.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Wood Nymph</span>,” the letter said. “Why
won’t you come and play with us, instead of hiding
away in the thickets? We are just four
young girls like yourself, so you need not be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
afraid of us. We found the red book in the patio,
so we know that you must have paid us a call
yesterday while we were away from Las Golondrinas.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you come and see us when we are
at home? We’d love to have you. The next time
you see us at the bathing-beach please come out
of the woods and show us that you are not a
tricksy sprite but a real live girl like ourselves.</p>

<p>“We are placing this note in a book which we
are sure you will like to read. We are going to
leave the book on the sands just where you found
the red book. After you have read it, won’t you
bring it straight to us and get acquainted?</p>

<p class="center">“Your friends,</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">The Wayfarers</span>.”</p>

</div>

<p>Below “The Wayfarers” Patsy had signed her
own name, allowing sufficient space on the page
for the names of her friends.</p>

<p>“That’s sweet in you, Patsy,” lauded Mabel.
“Give me your pen. I’ll sign my name in a
hurry.”</p>

<p>Mabel promptly affixed her name to the letter,
Beatrice following suit.</p>

<p>“We must get Nellie to sign it, too. You and
Bee take it to her, Mab,” Patsy requested. “I’m<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
going to ask Auntie if we can’t walk down to the
beach, for once, without an escort. It’s not as if
we were going bathing. We’ll just leave the
book and come straight back. We won’t be in
any danger.”</p>

<p>“Where’s the book?” inquired Bee.</p>

<p>“In my room. I’m going to put the letter in
that book we read on the train when we were
coming down here. You remember. It was ‘The
Oriole.’ It’s such a pretty story and not too
grown-up for our wood nymph. I’ll meet you
girls in the patio.”</p>

<p>While Bee and Mabel went to inform Eleanor
of the proposed expedition and obtain her signature
to the letter, Patsy took upon herself the
delicate task of interviewing her aunt.</p>

<p>She found Miss Martha on one of the balconies
which overlooked the patio, a bit of embroidery
in her hands, a book open on one knee.
Miss Carroll had triumphantly mastered the difficult
art of reading and embroidering at the same
time.</p>

<p>Having come to the belief that it was really the
girls’ wood nymph who had taken and subsequently
returned her book, Miss Martha was now
inclined to lay less stress on the incident. Her
theory of tramps having been shaken, she demurred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
a little, then gave a somewhat reluctant
consent to Patsy’s plea.</p>

<p>“You may go this once, but be sure you keep
together and don’t loiter down there at the beach.
I can’t say I specially approve of your trying
to make friends with this young heathen. Once
you come to know her you may find her very
troublesome. However, you may be able to help
her in some way. Your motive is good. That’s
really the only reason I can give for allowing
you to carry out your plan. Be sure you come
back in time for luncheon.”</p>

<p>“You’re as good as gold, Auntie, dear.”
Patsy tumultuously embraced Miss Martha.</p>

<p>“Really, Patsy, you fairly pull one to pieces,”
grumbled Miss Carroll, grabbing ineffectually for
embroidery and book as she emerged from that
bear-like embrace.</p>

<p>“You like it, though.” Patsy deftly garnered
book and embroidery from the balcony floor and
restored them to Miss Carroll’s lap. Dropping a
kiss on her aunt’s snowy hair she light-heartedly
left the balcony to go to her own room for the
book which was to play an important part in her
kindly little plan.</p>

<p>Hastily securing the book, Patsy set her broad-brimmed
Panama on her auburn head at a rakish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
angle and dashed from the room in her usual
whirlwind fashion, banging the door behind her.</p>

<p>A few steps and she had entered the picture
gallery through which she intended to pass on
her way to the stairs. As she entered it a faint
sound assailed her ears. She could not place in
her own mind the nature of the sound, yet it startled
her, simply because it had proceeded from
the very center of the gallery.</p>

<p>An unbidden impulse caused her to direct her
eyes toward the portrait cavalier. She caught her
breath sharply. A curious chill crept up and
down her spine. Was she dreaming, or had the
man in the picture actually moved? With a
little gasp of terror Patsy fled for the stairs and
clattered down them, feeling as though the sinister
cavalier was directly at her heels.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV<br />
<span class="smaller">A REAL ADVENTURE</span></h2>

<p>“What on earth is the matter?”</p>

<p>Seated on a bench beside Mabel
and Eleanor, Bee sprang up in alarm
as Patsy fairly tore into the patio and dropped
limply upon another seat.</p>

<p>“Oh, girls, the picture!” she exclaimed. “That
cavalier! He <em>moved</em>! I’m sure he did! It gave
me the creeps! I was hustling through the gallery
and I heard a faint, queer noise. I can’t describe
it. It seemed to come right from the middle
of the gallery. I looked toward that picture
and it moved, or else the cavalier moved. I don’t
know which.”</p>

<p>“You just thought you saw something move,”
soothed Bee, sitting down beside her chum and
patting her hand. “It was probably the way the
light happened to strike on the picture that made
it seem so. As for a queer sound! Every sound<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
echoes and re-echoes in these old corridors. We
heard you bang your door clear down here. You
must have heard an echo of that bang in the gallery.”</p>

<p>“I’m a goose, I guess.” Patsy sheepishly
ducked her head. “I never thought of the light
falling like that on the picture. That’s what I
saw, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“What has happened, Patsy?” called a dignified
but anxious voice from the balcony. Miss
Martha stood leaning over the rail looking down
concernedly at her niece.</p>

<p>“Nothing, Auntie, dear. I heard a queer noise
in the gallery and it startled me. Bee says it was
only the echo from the bang I gave my door. I’m
all right,” Patsy sturdily insisted, rising from the
seat and blowing a gay little kiss to her aunt.</p>

<p>“I <em>heard</em> you bang your door,” was the significant
response. “When you come back from your
walk you must take one of those capsules that
Dr. Hilliard prescribed for my nerves.”</p>

<p>“All right,” Patsy dutifully agreed. “Good-bye,
Auntie. We’re going now.”</p>

<p>“Good-bye. Remember to be back by one
o’clock.”</p>

<p>The three other girls calling a blithe good-bye
to Miss Carroll, the quartette left the patio with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
an alacrity that betokened their eagerness for the
proposed walk.</p>

<p>“I didn’t care to tell her about thinking I saw
the picture move,” confessed Patsy. “As it is
I’m in for swallowing one of those fat nerve capsules
that Auntie always keeps on hand. I need
it about as much as a bird needs a hat. We’ll
have to walk fairly fast to get to the beach and
back by luncheon time, girls. We’ll lay the book
on the sand, then watch from the bath house windows
to see what happens.”</p>

<p>“I hope our wood nymph comes along and finds
it to-day,” commented Mabel. “Still she might
not go near the beach for several days. After
all, there’s only a chance that she’ll see it and pick
it up.”</p>

<p>“I have an idea she goes to the beach every
day,” said Beatrice. “She may be as curious
about us as we are about her. She may be so
shy, though, that she won’t come near us, even if
she does read our note.”</p>

<p>Thus discussing the object of their little
scheme, the Wayfarers forged ahead at a swinging
pace. Soon they had left the highway and
were on the narrow, white, palm-lined road to the
beach, talking busily as they went. Once in the
jungle four pairs of eyes kept up an alert watch
on both sides of the road in the hope of spying
the elusive wood nymph.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 460px;">
<img src="images/illus3.jpg" width="460" height="650" alt="" />
<p class="caption">She caught her breath sharply, … had
the man in the picture actually moved?</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>They came at last to the beach, however, without
having seen any signs of their quarry. After
they had gone through the little ceremony of
placing the book on the spot on the sands from
which the other book had disappeared, they went
over to the bath house and, entering, eagerly
watched from one of its windows.</p>

<p>After lingering there for half an hour, during
which period the fateful book remained exactly
where it had been laid, they gave up the vigil for
that day and reluctantly started on the homeward
hike.</p>

<p>“Of course we couldn’t really expect anything
would happen just because we wanted it to,” declared
Eleanor.</p>

<p>“Of course not,” her chums concurred. In her
heart, however, each girl had been secretly hoping
that something <em>would</em> happen.</p>

<p>The following morning saw the Wayfarers
again on the sands. This time, however, they
had come down to the beach for a swim, Miss
Martha dutifully accompanying them.</p>

<p>Almost the first object which met their gaze
when they reached the sands was the book. It
still lay exactly where Patsy had deposited it, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
white edge of the letter showing above the book’s
blue binding.</p>

<p>“She hasn’t been here!” Patsy cried out disappointedly.
“I guess our plan isn’t going to
amount to much after all.”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t be discouraged,” smiled Eleanor.
“Give her time.”</p>

<p>“Let’s forget all about it,” suggested Bee.
“Nothing ever happens when one’s awfully anxious
for it to happen. It generally happens
after one has stopped thinking about it and gone
on to something else. It’s a glorious morning for
a swim. Let’s hurry into our bathing suits and
take advantage of it.”</p>

<p>This wise view of the matter appealing to the
disappointed authors of the little plot, the four
girls betook themselves to the bath house to get
ready for their morning dip in the ocean.</p>

<p>Having now become mildly interested in
Patsy’s scheme to catch a wood nymph, Miss
Martha took pains to further it by establishing
herself on the sands at a point on the far side of
the bath house. From there she could neither
see the spot where the book lay, nor could anyone
who might chance to approach it see her. This
maneuver was not lost on her charges, who agreed
with Patsy’s gleeful assertion that Auntie was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
just as anxious for “something to happen” as
they were.</p>

<p>Soon engrossed in the fun of splashing and
swimming about in the sun-warmed salt water,
the Wayfarers forgot everything that did not
pertain to the enjoyment of the moment.</p>

<p>True, on first entering the surf Patsy cast an
occasional glance beachward. Bee’s merry challenge,
“I’ll race you again to-day as far as the
bend and back,” was the last touch needed to
drive all thought of the mysterious wood nymph
from Patsy’s mind.</p>

<p>Sturdy Bee proved herself no mean antagonist.
When Patsy finally arrived at the starting point
only a yard ahead of her chum, she was ready to
throw herself down on the sands and rest after
her strenuous swim. Bee, however, showed no
sign of fatigue.</p>

<p>“You beat me, but only by a yard. To-morrow
I’ll beat you.” Bee stood over Patsy, flushed
and laughing.</p>

<p>“I don’t doubt it.” Patsy glanced admiringly
up at her chum. “You’re a stronger swimmer
than I, Bee. With a little more practice you’ll
be a wonder. Here I am resting. You look
ready to start out all over again.”</p>

<p>“I’m not a bit tired,” Bee said with a little air<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
of pride. “I’ll prove it by swimming out there
where Mabel and Nellie are.”</p>

<p>Stretched full length in the sand, Patsy lazily
sat up and watched her chum as Bee waded out in
the surf, reached swimming depth and struck out
for a point not far ahead where Mabel and Eleanor
were placidly swimming about.</p>

<p>Indolently content to remain inactive, Patsy
continued to watch her three friends for a little,
then lay down again, one arm thrown across her
eyes to shut out the sun.</p>

<p>While she lay there, enjoying the luxury of
thinking about nothing in particular, tardy recollection
of the blue book suddenly crossed her
brain. It impelled her to sit up again with a jerk
and cast a quick glance toward the object of her
thoughts.</p>

<p>Next instant a bare-footed figure in a white
bathing suit flashed across the sands toward the
jungle on a wild run. In that one glance Patsy
had seen more than the blue book. She had seen
a slim young girl, her small, beautiful face framed
in masses of midnight black hair, flit suddenly
out of the jungle, eagerly snatch up the book
and dart off with it.</p>

<p>First sight of the strange girl and Patsy’s
original intention to await developments flew to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
the winds. Obeying a mad impulse to pursue the
vanishing wood nymph, Patsy plunged into the
jungle after her, crying out loudly: “Wait a
minute! I want to talk to you.”</p>

<p>At sound of the clear, high voice the black-haired
girl ahead halted briefly. Through the
open screen of green, Patsy could see her quite
plainly. She was looking over her shoulder at
her pursuer as though undetermined whether to
stand her ground or continue her flight.</p>

<p>“Don’t be afraid,” Patsy called out encouragingly.
“Please don’t run away.”</p>

<p>As she spoke she started quickly forward. Her
eyes fixed on the girl, her runaway feet plunged
themselves into a mass of tangled green vines.
With a sharp, “Oh!” she pitched headlong into a
thicket of low-growing bushes.</p>

<p>As she scrambled to her feet she became aware
of a loud, metallic buzzing in her ears. Then she
felt herself being jerked out of the thicket by a
pair of strong arms and hauled to a bit of dear
space beyond.</p>

<p>“Stay where you are, <i lang="es">señorita</i>,” commanded a
warning, imperative voice. “Move not, I entreat
you!”</p>

<p>Bewildered by the suddenness with which
things had happened, Patsy stood perfectly still,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
her eyes following the movements of a lithe figure,
darting this way and that, as though in search
of something.</p>

<p>Still in a daze she heard the voice that had
addressed her utter a low murmur of satisfaction,
as its owner stooped and picked up a dead branch
from under a huge live oak. Two little brown
hands played like lightning over the thick branch,
ripping off the clinging dead twigs. Next the
denuded branch was thwacked vigorously against
the parent oak.</p>

<p>“It is strong enough,” announced a calm voice.
“Now we shall see.”</p>

<p>Fascinated, Patsy watched breathlessly. She
now understood the situation. Her headlong
crash into the thicket had stirred up a drowsy
rattler. The prompt action of her little wood
nymph had saved her from being bitten by the
snake. Now the girl intended to hunt it down
and kill it. She looked so small and slender. It
seemed too dangerous a task for her to undertake.</p>

<p>“Oh, please let it alone! It might bite you!”
Patsy found herself faltering out. “A rattle-snake’s
bite is deadly.”</p>

<p>“I have killed many. I am not afraid. Always
one must kill the snake. It is the sign of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
the enemy. One kills; so one conquers. <i lang="es">Comprende?</i>”</p>

<p>The girl shook back her black hair, her red lips
parting in a smile that lighted her somber face
into sunshine. Patsy thought it quite the prettiest
thing she had ever seen.</p>

<p>Very cautiously the intrepid little hunter began
to circle the thicket, poking her impromptu
weapon into it with every step she took.</p>

<p>“Ah!”</p>

<p>She uttered a shout of triumph as the sinister,
buzzing sound Patsy had so lately heard began
again.</p>

<p>Having located her quarry, the girl proceeded
to dispatch it with the fearlessness of those long
used to the wilds. Her weapon firmly grasped
in determined hands she rained a fury of strong,
steady blows upon the rattler. Finally they
ceased. Giving his snakeship a final contemptuous
prod with the branch, she called across the
thicket to Patsy:</p>

<p>“Come. You wish to see. He is a very large
one. Of a length of eight feet, <i lang="es">quisas</i>. Wait; I
will lay him straight on the earth.”</p>

<p>Approaching, Patsy shuddered as her rescuer
obligingly poked the dead reptile from the spot
where it had made its last stand. She shuddered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
again as a small brown hand grasped the still
twitching tail and straightened the snake out.</p>

<p>“It is the diamond back,” the girl calmly informed.
“See.” She pointed with the branch,
which she still held, to the diamond-shaped markings
on the snake’s back. “He carried the death
in his sting. So we shall bury the head, for the
sting of a dead snake such as this is safer covered.”</p>

<p>“It’s horrible!” shivered Patsy. “It was coiled
up in the thicket. I must have disturbed it when
I fell. I don’t see how I escaped being bitten.”</p>

<p>“He was resting at the edge of the thicket,
<i lang="es">señorita</i>,” corrected the girl. “Always such as he
keep near the edge so that it becomes for them
thus easy to strike the small creatures they hunt.
So you missed him and he sang the song of death.
I heard that song and came. He had eaten not
long ago, I believe, and was lazy. So he did not
try to go away. Now he is dead. So if the enemy
comes to me, I must conquer. This is a true saying.”</p>

<span class="smaller">DOLORES</span></h2>

<p>A sudden silence fell upon the two girls
as the picturesque little stranger made
this solemn announcement. Now that
the excitement was over the wood nymph began
to show signs of returning shyness.</p>

<p>Fearing that she might turn and run away,
Patsy stretched forth a slim white hand and said
winningly:</p>

<p>“I can’t begin to tell you how grateful I am
for what you did. You were very brave, I think.
I’m ever so glad to know you. Can’t we be
friends?”</p>

<p>The girl hesitated, a wistful look in her large
dark eyes. Very slowly she put her small brown
hand into Patsy’s extended one.</p>

<p>“I will give you the hand because already I
like you,” she said. “I cannot be your friend
because I am too poor. Always I must wear the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
old ugly dress. Always I must go with the feet
bare.”</p>

<p>“That has nothing to do with our being
friends,” was Patsy’s gentle assurance. “I’m
bare-footed, too.” She laughed and thrust forward
one pink, bare foot. “Just look at my bathing
suit. It was wet when I started after you.
Falling down didn’t improve it.”</p>

<p>“Ah, but your feet are bare because you wish
it,” reminded the girl sadly. “Never I wish the
bare feet, but always it must be. I have seen you
the other day in the automobile. You and your
friends I saw. <i lang="es">Mi madre</i> you were most wonderful!
You were <i lang="es">linda</i>; <i lang="es">hermosa</i>!”</p>

<p>The girl clasped her brown hands in a fervent
gesture as she relapsed into Spanish by way of
emphasizing her ardent admiration.</p>

<p>“I was behind the hedge and saw you go,” she
continued apologetically. “With me was the
red book, I would to bring it back. Was it
wrong to take it for one day? I desired it much.”</p>

<p>“You were very welcome to it,” smiled Patsy.
“We found it in the patio with your thank you.
Did you read it?”</p>

<p>“<i lang="es">Si</i>; but not all. It was long, with such hard
words. <i lang="es">No comprendia</i> all. It told of the
<i lang="es">amor</i>. That is the love, you know. Yet <i lang="es">amor</i> is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
the more sweet word. It is the Spanish. You
must know that I am Spanish, but I speak the
English quite well, though for a long time I have
spoken it little.”</p>

<p>“I should say you did speak it well!” emphasized
Patsy.</p>

<p>As it happened, Patsy was already decidedly
amazed at this fact. Though the girl’s phraseology
was a trifle clumsy at times, in the main her
English was grammatical. To Patsy she was a
bewildering combination of childish frankness,
sturdy independence, shy humility and quaint
charm. Above all, there hung over her that curious
air of mystery which wholly fascinated
Patsy.</p>

<p>“You have said you desire to be to me the
friend. So I shall tell you why I speak the
English,” pursued the wood nymph in a sudden
burst of confidence. “First, we must bury the
head of this,” she pointed to the dead snake,
“then I will show you the place under the tree
where we may sit for a little.”</p>

<p>“I’d love to,” eagerly responded Patsy.</p>

<p>Completely wrapped up in the adventure, impetuous
Patsy had entirely forgotten the passing
of time. The effect her disappearance would
have on her friends had not yet occurred to her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
Her mind was centered on her new acquaintance,
who was now busily engaged in digging a hole in
the soft earth with a sharp stone she had picked
up.</p>

<p>“It is done,” she announced, when the crushed,
ugly head of the reptile was hidden from view
and the earth pounded down over it. “Come
now. I will show you. Follow me and fear not.
We shall not see another such snake, I believe.”</p>

<p>Following her lively companion for a few yards
of comparatively easy going, the two came to a
wide-spreading palmetto under which was a space
clear of vines and bushes. Only the short green
grass grew luxuriantly there.</p>

<p>“This place I love. I have myself made it free
of the vines and weeds. Here I love to lie and
look up through the trees at the sky. Sit you
down and we will talk.”</p>

<p>Only too willing to “talk,” Patsy obeyed with
alacrity. The wood nymph seated herself beside
Patsy, endeavoring to cover her bare feet and
limbs with her faded brown cotton skirt. Slim
hands clasped about her knees, she stared solemnly
at the white-clad girl beside her.</p>

<p>“I am Dolores,” she began. “That means the
sadness. I have lived here long, but before that
I lived with my father in Miami. My mother I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
never knew. I was the little baby when she died.
So I went to a school and learned English. Now
I have seventeen years, but in Miami, when I was
of an age of twelve years, my father, who did the
work every day of the <i lang="es">carpintero</i>, became very
sick. So he died, but before he died he wrote the
letter to his friend who came for me and brought
me here. So never more I went to school but had
always the hard work to do.”</p>

<p>“You poor little thing!” exclaimed Patsy, her
ready sympathies touched by the wistfulness of
the girl’s tones as she related her sad little story.
“Where do you live now, and why do you have
to work so hard?”</p>

<p>“These things I cannot tell you. It is forbidden.”
The girl mournfully shook her head. “So
it is true also that I cannot be your friend. But
if you will come here sometimes, I will see you,”
she added, her lovely, somber features brightening.</p>

<p>“Of course I will, and bring my friends with
me. They are dandy girls, ever so much nicer
than I. My name is Patricia Carroll, but everyone
calls me ‘Patsy.’ Why can’t you come to Las
Golondrinas to see us?”</p>

<p>“It is forbidden. <em>Never</em> I can go there again.
I am sorry.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>The brightness faded from the stranger’s beautiful
face, leaving it more melancholy than before.</p>

<p>Patsy looked briefly baffled, then tried again
with:</p>

<p>“Come down to the beach with me now and
meet them and my aunt.” Sudden remembrance
of Miss Martha caused her to exclaim: “Good
gracious! I wonder what time it is! None of my
friends knows where I went. They’ll be terribly
worried.”</p>

<p>Patsy sprang to her feet in dismay. She wondered
if she had really been away from the beach
so very long. She was of the rueful conviction
that she had.</p>

<p>“I would go, but I am afraid. If she saw me
she would be angry and shut me up for many
days. So she has said.”</p>

<p>This was even more amazing to Patsy. She
longed to ask this strange girl all sorts of questions.
Courtesy forbade her to do so. She also
had a vague idea that it would be of no use. Fear
of the person she had referred to as “she” had evidently
tied the wood nymph’s tongue.</p>

<p>“I’d love to have you come with me,” Patsy
said warmly. “But I wouldn’t want you to do
anything that might bring trouble upon yourself.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
Is it right that you should obey this&mdash;this
person?”</p>

<p>“No; never it is right!” The answer came in
bitter, resentful tones. “Often I think to run
away from here, never to return. Only I have
the no place to go. I am truly the poor one. Dolores!”
She made a little despairing gesture.
“<i lang="es">Si</i>, it is the true name for me.”</p>

<p>“Then if you feel that it is not right to obey a
person who is treating you unjustly, don’t do it,”
was Patsy’s bold counsel. “I wish you would tell
me your trouble. Perhaps I could help you.
Won’t you trust me and tell me about it?”</p>

<p>“I am afraid,” was the mournful repetition.
“Not afraid of you. Oh, never that! Already I
have for you the <i lang="es">amor</i>. You are <i lang="es">simpatica</i>. I
would to go to the sands with you now and meet
your friends. I cannot. I will show you the
way to the road. So you can walk more quickly
to the sands. I will try to come to this place to-morrow
at this time and wait for you.”</p>

<p>“May I bring the girls with me?” petitioned
Patsy. “My chum, Beatrice, saw you in the
thicket the first time we came to the beach. She
is longing to know you.”</p>

<p>“Beatrice; it is the pretty name. She is perhaps
that one with the true face and the brown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
curls. I saw her look at me that day. She is not
so pretty as you; yet she is pretty. So, also, are
those other two girls who look alike and still not
alike.”</p>

<p>“They are sisters; Mabel and Eleanor,” informed
Patsy. “At home, away up North, they
live next door to me. When I come here to-morrow
I will tell you more about myself. I must
go now. You haven’t said yet whether I might
bring my chums with me to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“I wish it,” was the brief consent. “Now I
will show you the way.”</p>

<p>It was not as far as Patsy had thought to the
sandy road. Guided by Dolores, who knew her
ground thoroughly, Patsy found jungle travel
easy, even in her bare feet. The two girls finally
came out on the road about an eighth of a mile
above the beach.</p>

<p>“Thank you ever so much for showing me the
way.”</p>

<p>Patsy paused in the middle of the road, her
hand extended. Impulsively she leaned forward
and lightly kissed Dolores.</p>

<p>The vivid color in the girl’s cheeks deepened
at the unexpected caress. A mist sprang to her
glorious dark eyes. She caught Patsy’s hand in
both her own. Bending, she touched her lips to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
it. “Oh, you are most <i lang="es">simpatica</i>!” she murmured,
then turned and darted away, leaving
Patsy standing in the middle of the white, sandy
road, looking tenderly after the lithe, fleeing form
until a tangle of green hid it entirely from her
view.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI<br />
<span class="smaller">NOTHING OR SOMETHING?</span></h2>

<p>Meanwhile, down on the sands,
three anxious-eyed girls were holding
counsel with an equally disturbed matron.</p>

<p>“When did you see Patsy last?” Miss Martha
was inquiring in lively alarm.</p>

<p>“She was lying in the sand when I started to
swim out to Mab and Nellie,” replied Bee.
“When I got to them, Mab began splashing water
on me and we had a busy time for a few minutes
just teasing each other. Then I looked toward
the beach. I was going to call out to Patsy to
come on in, but she wasn’t there. I supposed, of
course, she’d gone up to the bath house to take
off her bathing suit and dress again. She had
said she was tired.”</p>

<p>“How long ago was that?” Miss Martha asked
huskily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>“An hour, I’m afraid; perhaps longer,” faltered
Bee. “We’ve looked all along the beach
and called to her. We looked in the bath house
first before we told you, Miss Martha. We hated
to frighten you. We kept expecting she’d come
back. We thought maybe she was hiding from
us just for fun and would pounce out on us all
of a sudden.”</p>

<p>“You should have told me at once, Beatrice.”</p>

<p>Worry over her niece’s strange disappearance
lent undue sternness to Miss Carroll’s voice.</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I&mdash;am&mdash;sorry.”</p>

<p>Bee was now on the verge of tears.</p>

<p>“So am I,” was the grim concurrence. “At all
events, Patsy must be found and immediately.
I shall not wait for you girls to change your bathing
suits. I shall walk back to the house at once.
You are to go into the bath house and stay there
until my brother comes for you. He will bring
men with him who will search the woods behind
the beach.”</p>

<p>“Won’t you let me try again along the edge of
jungle, Miss Martha,” pleaded Bee. “I won’t
go far into it. I’ll just skirt it and keep calling
out&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Who-oo!” suddenly supplemented a clear,
high voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>It had an electrical effect upon the dismayed
group. Out from the jungle and onto the beach
darted a small, bare-footed, white-clad figure and
straight into the midst of a most relieved company.</p>

<p>“Patricia Carroll, <em>where</em> have you been?” demanded
Miss Martha sternly. “No; don’t try
to smooth things over by hugging me. I am <em>very</em>
angry with you for disobeying me.”</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Miss Martha made only a feeble
attempt to disengage herself from Patsy’s coaxing
arms.</p>

<p>“Now, Auntie, don’t be cross. A Patsy in
hand is worth two in the jungle,” saucily paraphrased
the unabashed culprit. “I’ve been as
safe as safe could be. I’ve really had a wonderful
time. I was so interested I forgot that very
likely you might miss me and be a little worried.”</p>

<p>“<em>A little worried!</em>”</p>

<p>Miss Martha raised two plump hands in a despairing
gesture.</p>

<p>“Why, yes. I&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Do you know how long you’ve been gone?”
was the severe question. “Long enough to set
us all nearly distracted wondering what had become
of you. Really, Patsy, I think you’ve behaved
very inconsiderately.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’m sorry, dearest Auntie; truly I am. I
didn’t mean to be gone so long. I saw her and
before I knew it I was following her as fast as I
could run. She came out of the jungle after the
book.”</p>

<p>“Saw her? Do you mean our&mdash;&mdash;” Mabel began
excitedly.</p>

<p>“Wood nymph,” Patsy finished triumphantly.
“I surely do. I not only <em>saw</em> her. I talked with
her.”</p>

<p>“I might have known it,” came disapprovingly
from Miss Carroll. “I should have set my foot
down firmly in the first place about this girl. I
thought you too sensible by far to race off into a
snake-infested jungle, bare-footed, at that, after
this young savage. I see I was mistaken.”</p>

<p>“She’s not a savage, Aunt Martha.” Patsy
rallied to defense of her new friend. “She’s a
perfect darling. She’s Spanish, but she speaks
really good English in such a quaint, pretty way.
She likes me and I like her, and we’re friends.
We’ve shaken hands on that.”</p>

<p>“What is her name, Patsy, and where does she
live?” eagerly asked Eleanor.</p>

<p>“Her name is Dolores. I don’t know where she
lives,” confessed Patsy. “I asked her but she
wouldn’t tell me. She said it was forbidden. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
asked her to come to Las Golondrinas to see us,
but she said that was forbidden, too. She read
your book, Auntie. I told you she wasn’t ignorant.”</p>

<p>“What did she say about the ‘Oriole’?” interposed
Bee, before Miss Carroll could frame an
adequate reply to Patsy’s astounding announcement.</p>

<p>“I&mdash;&mdash;Why, the idea! I forgot to ask her,”
stammered Patsy. “I saw her pick up the book
and run away with it. I started after her. Then
I fell almost on that horrible snake and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Snake!” went up in shocked unison from four
throats.</p>

<p>“Why, yes.” Patsy colored, then grinned boyishly.
“I was going to tell you about it in a minute.
I caught my foot in some vines and pitched
into the bushes. I stirred up a rattler. It began
to sing and Dolores ran to me and dragged me
away from the place before it had time to bite
me. Then she killed it. It was as thick as my
wrist and eight feet long. She said it was a diamond&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I must say you have very peculiar ideas of
safety,” interrupted her aunt.</p>

<p>Despite the dry satire of her tones, Miss Martha
was feeling rather sick over Patsy’s near disaster.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
In consequence, she was inclined toward
tardy appreciation of the “young savage.”</p>

<p>“This girl,” she continued in a dignified but
decidedly mollified voice. “I feel that we ought
to do something for her. You say she insists that
it is forbidden her to come to Las Golondrinas.
Did she explain why?”</p>

<p>“No. I wanted awfully to ask her, but I felt
sure that she wouldn’t tell me a thing. There’s
a mystery connected with her. I know there
is.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” Miss Martha showed instant annoyance
at this theory. “I dare say her parents
have merely forbidden her to trespass upon the
property of strangers. I have been told that
these persons known down South as ‘poor whites’
still feel very resentful toward Northerners on
account of the Civil War. The old folks have
handed down this hatred to the younger generations.
This girl’s parents have no doubt learned
that we are from the North.”</p>

<p>“But such people as these poor whites are
Americans with American ancestors. Dolores
is Spanish. Besides, her father and mother are
dead. She said so.”</p>

<p>Patsy went on to repeat the meager account
Dolores had given of herself, ending with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
girl’s allusion to the mysterious “she” of whom
she appeared to stand in such lively dread.</p>

<p>“Very unsatisfactory,” commented her aunt
when Patsy had finished her narration. “Understand,
Patsy, I am grateful to this girl for the
service she did you. As for the girl herself&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Miss Martha’s pause was eloquent of doubt.</p>

<p>“She’s perfectly sweet,” insisted Patsy with
some warmth.</p>

<p>“Nevertheless, you know nothing of her beyond
what she has chosen to tell you,” firmly
maintained Miss Carroll. “I don’t approve of
her dodging about in the woods like a wild young
animal. For all you know this ‘she’ may have
been put to a great deal of uneasiness by the
girl’s will-o’-the-wisp behavior. She may be so
headstrong and disobedient as to require the
adoption of strong measures.”</p>

<p>“She’s not that sort of girl,” Patsy again defended.
“She’s gentle and dear and lovable.
When she smiles her face lights up just beautifully.
Mostly, though, she’s terribly sober. Her
voice is so soft and sweet. Only it makes one feel
like crying.”</p>

<p>“Hmm!” The ejaculation was slightly skeptical.
“She seems to have completely turned
your head, Patricia. I suppose you will give me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
no peace until I have seen her for myself. I am
a fairly good judge of character, however. It
will not take me long to decide whether she is a
proper person for you to cultivate.”</p>

<p>“Then come with me into the woods to-morrow,”
eagerly challenged Patsy. “I promised to
meet her there, at a certain place, and bring the
girls. I’m not the least bit afraid you won’t like
Dolores. I know that you will.”</p>

<p>“What! flounder through that jungle and risk
snake bite? No, indeed! Furthermore, I forbid
you girls to do so.”</p>

<p>“Then we can’t see her!” Patsy cried out disappointedly.
“I told you she said she was afraid
to meet us on the beach. Listen, dearest and
bestest Auntie. As we go back over the road to
the house, I’ll show you the place where Dolores
wants us to meet her. It’s only a little way off
the road and easy to reach. There isn’t the least
bit of danger from snakes. There’s a kind of
natural aisle between the trees that leads to it.
Dolores brought me back over it, so I know what
I’m talking about.”</p>

<p>“You may point it out to me as we go back
to the house,” was the nearest approach to consent
which Miss Carroll would give. “Now all
of you must hurry to the bath house and make up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
for lost time. It will be at least two o’clock before
we reach home. I will wait for you here.
Don’t stop to talk, but hurry.”</p>

<p>Once in the bath house, however, the Wayfarers’
tongues wagged incessantly as they speedily
prepared for the homeward hike.</p>

<p>Very naturally the conversation centered on
Dolores, of whom Patsy continued to hold forth
in glowing terms.</p>

<p>“Wait until Aunt Martha sees her,” she confidently
predicted. “She can’t help liking our
wood nymph. She was a tiny bit peeved when I
said that I knew there was a mystery about Dolores.
There is, too. I’m sure of it. She’s not
headstrong or disobedient, but she <em>is</em> terribly unhappy.
The person she lives with, that horrible
‘she,’ I suppose, must be awfully hateful to her.”</p>

<p>“Do you think we could find out for ourselves
where she lives?” Bee asked earnestly. “Then
we might be able to help her. She may need help
very badly. Your father said that she might be
the daughter of a fisherman.”</p>

<p>“We’ll try to find out.” Patsy spoke with
quick decision. “Day after to-morrow we’ll make
Dad take us to where those fisher folks live.
Maybe we’ll find her there. Don’t say a word
about it when you meet her to-morrow. We’ll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
just keep it dark and do a little sleuthing of our
own.”</p>

<p>Her companions agreeing with Patsy that this
would be an excellent plan, the quartette rapidly
finished dressing, locked the door of the bath
house behind them and joined Miss Carroll on
the beach.</p>

<p>“There’s the place where we are to meet Dolores,
Auntie,” informed Patsy when the party
reached the point on the road where she had left
her new friend. “It’s right beyond those oaks.
You can see for yourself that the walking is
good.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t quite so bad as I had expected,” Miss
Martha grudgingly admitted. “Since you are
so determined to introduce this girl to me, I may
as well resign myself to taking this walk with you
to-morrow.”</p>

<p>This being as good as a promise, wily Patsy
accepted it as such and said no more on the subject.
Added discussion of it might result in a
change of mind on her aunt’s part.</p>

<p>Reaching the house, however, a most unpleasant
surprise lay in wait for the party. To see
Mammy Luce standing in the entrance to the
patio was not an unusual sight. To see her stationed
there, however, her bulky form swathed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
an ancient linen duster, a shapeless black hat,
decorated with a depressed-looking ostrich plume
jammed down upon her gray wool, was another
matter. More, in one hand was a section of a
turkey red tablecloth, tied together at the four
corners and bulging with her personal belongings.
In the other hand she held a green cotton umbrella
which she raised in a kind of fantastic salute
as the Wayfarers approached the entrance.</p>

<p>“I’se gwine away fum here, I is,” she rumbled.
“I ain’t gwine stay in no house where sperrits
come sneakin’ aroun’. I done seen one this
mawnin’.”</p>

<p>“What does this mean, Mammy Luce?” Miss
Martha took majestic command of the situation.
“You have no right to leave me like this without
giving notice. Now tell me exactly what the
trouble is.”</p>

<p>“I done tell yoh a’ready, Missis. I done seen
a sperrit. I wuz bakin’ a cake, I wuz, in de
kitchen. I done looks up from de oben an’ I seen
a long, tall, ole white sperrit a-sneakin’ for de
back stairs. I near fell daid, I did. When I
come to, I wuz shakin’ like a leaf. So I jes’ put
mah traps togedder quick an’ now I’se gwine. I’se
been awaitin’ to tell yoh an ax yoh fer mah
wages.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>“There are no such things as ‘spirits,’ Mammy
Luce,” Miss Carroll informed the frightened servant.
“You only thought you saw one.”</p>

<p>Alarmed at the prospect of losing an excellent
cook, Miss Martha proceeded to do her utmost to
convince the old woman that her visitant, provided
she really had seen an apparition, was not
supernatural.</p>

<p>“I seen it. I ain’t blind. I seen it,” Mammy
Luce doggedly reiterated. “Yoh cain’t tell this
niggah it wuzn’t no sperrit, ’cause it wuz.”</p>

<p>“Much more likely it was one of the maids who
dressed up in a sheet on purpose to frighten you,”
was Miss Martha’s practical view of the matter.
“Where are Celia and Emily?”</p>

<p>“Em’ly she am upstaihs somewhar. She don’t
know nuffin’ ’bout it, an’ this am Celia’s day off.
Dey am good girls an’ don’t go for to skair ole
Mammy Luce. ’Sides, this yeah sperrit wuz ’bout
seben foot high. It wuzn’t no <em>pusson</em>. It ain’t
no use talkin’, Mis’ Carroll, ’cause I’se gwine ter
git out fore dat sperrit gits after this niggah. It
ain’t no fun to be daid an’ I ain’t gwine to be
it.”</p>

<p>Further argument on the part of not only Miss
Martha but the girls as well proved futile.
Mammy Luce had but one thought. That<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
thought was to put distance between herself and
Las Golondrinas. The substantial increase of
wages Miss Carroll felt impelled to offer her did
not interest the superstitious old woman.</p>

<p>“I jes’ want what’s acomin’ to muh an’ git
out,” she declared with finality. “I’se gwine ober
yander ’bout three mile toh see mah brudder.
He’ll hitch up his ole yaller mule an’ tote ole Luce
toh the station.”</p>

<p>“Go upstairs, Patsy, to my room and bring me
my handbag. It is in the tray of my trunk.
Here is the key.”</p>

<p>From the white crocheted bag swinging from
one arm, Miss Carroll took a small brass key
which she handed to Patsy.</p>

<p>As she passed through the patio and thence on
upstairs, recollection of the curious impression
she had received that morning in walking through
the portrait gallery came back to Patsy.</p>

<p>She had been absolutely sure at the moment
that the pictured cavalier had moved. Mammy
Luce, it seemed, was equally sure that she had
seen a “sperrit.” The question that now obtruded
itself in Patsy’s mind was, had she and Mammy
Luce seen <em>nothing</em>, or had both of them really
seen <em>something</em>?</p>

<span class="smaller">PUZZLING OVER THE PUZZLE</span></h2>

<p>Now minus a cook, it remained to the
Wayfarers to prepare their own luncheon.
Not stopping to bewail their cookless
state, the four girls, under the direction of
Miss Martha, attacked the task with the utmost
good humor.</p>

<p>Miss Carroll, however, was not so optimistically
inclined. Mammy Luce’s sudden departure
had deprived her of a skilled cook, whom she
could not easily replace. She was thankful that
the panic had not extended to the maids. Providentially,
Celia was absent for the day. According
to Mammy Luce, Emily was still in ignorance
of the “sperrit’s” visitation. She had eaten her
noonday meal and gone back to her upstairs work
before Mammy Luce had seen the dread apparition.</p>

<p>In the midst of preparations for the belated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
luncheon, she appeared in the kitchen, broom and
duster in hand, her black eyes round with curiosity
at the unusual sight which met them.</p>

<p>In as casual a tone as she could muster, Miss
Carroll informed the girl that Mammy Luce had
left Las Golondrinas. This news appeared not
to surprise Emily so much as had the sight of
the “young ladies an’ the Missis aworkin’ in de
kitchen.”</p>

<p>“Huh!” was her scornful ejaculation. “I guess
ole Luce done got skairt ’bout dat ere ghos’. Carlos
wuz tellin’ her ’bout it t’other day. That
Spanish fellah in the queer duds up thar in the
pitcher gallery done walk aroun’ this house. He
go fer to say he’s seen it. He am a liar. They
ain’t no sech things ’s ghos’es, I says, but Luce,
she says they is. She wuz ’fraid she’d see it.”</p>

<p>“Certainly there are no such things as ghosts,
Emily,” Miss Martha made haste to agree. “I
am glad to find you so sensible on the subject.
Since you have mentioned it, I might as well say
that it was this ghost idea which caused Mammy
Luce to leave us.”</p>

<p>Miss Martha diplomatically avoided making a
direct explanation of the affair. Once Emily
learned Mammy Luce had insisted that she had
actually <em>seen</em> a ghost, she might not remain firm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
in her conviction that there were “no sech things.”</p>

<p>“I hope Celia has no such foolish ideas about
ghosts as Mammy Luce,” Miss Carroll continued
inquiringly.</p>

<p>“Celie, she’s ’bout half an’ half. She says as
thar might be or mightn’t. Only she says she
ain’t gwine to git skairt ’less she sees one. Celie’n
me, we don’t take no stock in that good-fer-nuffin’
Carlos. He am a sorehead, he am. Ef it’s
’greeable, Mis’ Carroll, I reckon I ain’t sech a
bad cook. Leastways, I don’ mind tryin’. Ef
yoh likes mah cookin’ mebbe I can git mah sister
t’ come an’ do mah work.”</p>

<p>This was joyful news indeed. Needless to
mention, Miss Carroll was not slow to take good-natured
Emily at her word.</p>

<p>“I shall be very glad to have you try, Emily,”
she said. “If you can get along with the cooking
it will save us the trouble of sending to Miami
for another cook. Where does your sister live?
Perhaps she wouldn’t care to come here for so
short a time.”</p>

<p>“She lives home with mah mudder, Mis’ Carroll.
Jes’ a little ways from Miami. She am only
fifteen, but she am right smaht. I done gwine t’
write her t’night,” assured Emily, showing her
white teeth in a wide grin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>“Do so, Emily. To have your sister come here
will simplify matters wonderfully.”</p>

<p>Miss Martha looked her relief at this unexpected
solution of the domestic problem.</p>

<p>With the deft assistance of Emily, the luncheon
which the Wayfarers had busied themselves
in preparing was soon on the dining-room table.
It consisted of bread and butter, bacon, an omelet,
and a salad, composed of tomatoes, green sweet
peppers and lettuce, with French dressing. The
fateful cake which Mammy Luce was removing
from the oven when she saw the “sperrit”
now figured as dessert along with oranges which
Patsy had painstakingly sliced and sugared.</p>

<p>Previous to Emily’s disappearance, the preparation
of luncheon had been accompanied by much
talk and laughter on the part of the Wayfarers.
Presently seated at table, they had considerably
less to say. Emily’s revelation concerning Carlos
had set them all to wondering and speculating.</p>

<p>“It strikes me that this Carlos has very little
good sense,” Miss Martha criticized the moment
Emily had left the dining-room. “He should
have known better than tell such a tale to old
Mammy Luce. I shall speak to your father
about him, Patsy.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>“When we asked him about the portrait gallery
he said he didn’t know a thing,” Patsy replied
with a puzzled frown. “Do you suppose he really
told Mammy Luce about the picture and the
ghost? If he did, that proves he wasn’t telling
us the truth. Now why should he lie to us?”</p>

<p>“Very likely to get rid of answering your questions,”
responded her aunt. “Undoubtedly he
knew better than to tell you girls such a silly
story. He knew you would refer to it to your
father and that Robert would be displeased. I
believe Emily, of course. As to Mammy Luce,
I don’t know. It is exactly the sort of foolish
yarn that I warned you we were likely to hear
down South. I am sorry that it should have cost
us our cook.”</p>

<p>The tale of the ghostly cavalier was not disturbing
Miss Carroll in the least. The loss of a
cook was of far greater importance to her.</p>

<p>The Wayfarers, however, were more impressed
by Mammy Luce’s ghost than they dared allow
Miss Carroll to guess. During luncheon four
pairs of bright eyes continually exchanged significant
glances. They were burning to talk
things over among themselves.</p>

<p>Miss Carroll’s announcement that she intended
to take a nap directly after luncheon gave them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
the longed-for opportunity. Patsy’s demure invitation,
“Come on into Bee’s and my room,
Perry children,” held untold meaning.</p>

<p>“Girls,” began Patsy solemnly, the instant the
door of the room closed behind the quartette,
“there’s something queer about this old house.
There’s something queer about that picture.
Carlos knows more than he pretended to know.
I wouldn’t feel so&mdash;well, so funny about it if I
hadn’t thought I saw that cavalier in the picture
move. It gives me the shivers. Do you suppose
there is&mdash;&mdash;Oh, there simply can’t be a <em>ghost</em>
in this house!”</p>

<p>“Of course there isn’t,” smiled Bee. “Brace
up, Patsy. You’re just nervous over that picture
business this morning. I think perhaps Carlos
told Mammy Luce that story just to be malicious
and scare her. He looks like that sort of
person. Maybe he dislikes us as much as his
grandmother appeared to, and just because we
live in the house that belonged to his former employer.”</p>

<p>“If that’s the case, he may have told the yarn
to Mammy Luce on purpose to get her to leave,
and so inconvenience us,” suggested Eleanor.
“He may have thought she’d leave in a hurry
without telling us why she was going.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>“Let’s begin at the beginning and see what we
know,” proposed Bee. “First, there’s crazy old
Rosita who called us thieves and said we’d never
find something or other that Camillo, whoever
he is or was, had hidden. Second, there’s Carlos,
who turned out to be the grandson of Rosita,
who said she was not crazy but pretended to know
nothing else about anything here. Third, there’s
Mammy Luce, who went off and left us because
she saw, or thought she saw, a ghost. Fourth,
there’s Emily, who said Carlos told Mammy Luce
that the ghost of the cavalier in the picture gallery
walked about this house. Fifth, there’s
Patsy, who heard an odd noise in the gallery and
saw, or thought she saw, the cavalier picture
move. Put it all together. Does it mean something
or nothing?”</p>

<p>“No one except Carlos can answer that question.
The whole thing, except Patsy’s scare,
centers on him,” declared Mabel.</p>

<p>“I’m going to have a private talk with Dad,”
announced Patsy. “I’m going to ask him not to
speak to Carlos about the ghost story, but to let
him alone and see what happens next. If he
really has a grudge against us he’ll be sure to do
something else to bother us. We’ll be on the
watch and in that way we’ll catch him at it. Then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
maybe Dad can make him tell what he wouldn’t
tell us.”</p>

<p>“But what about your aunt, Patsy?” conscientiously
reminded Eleanor. “She’s going to ask
your father to speak to Carlos, you know.”</p>

<p>“I’ll see Dad first and explain things. I’ll ask
him to tell Auntie, when she mentions Carlos to
him, that he thinks it would be a good idea to let
Carlos alone for the present and watch him. It
<em>is</em> a good idea, and I know Dad will agree with
me. I’d say so to Auntie myself if I were sure
she wouldn’t mind. She would, though, because
she’s not in sympathy with us when it comes to
mysteries.”</p>

<p>“If any more queer things happen, Miss Martha
will have to admit that there <em>is</em> a mystery
hanging over Las Golondrinas,” Bee predicted.
“I forgot to add Dolores to the list. She’s another
mystery.”</p>

<p>“She surely is, but she doesn’t belong to the
Carlos puzzle,” returned Patsy. “Never mind,
give us time and we’ll put all the pieces of all the
puzzles together. We’re determined to do it.
That’s half the battle.”</p>

<p>“We may even find the secret drawer,” supplemented
Mabel hopefully.</p>

<p>This remark was received with derisive chuckles.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
Her companions had come to regard the
mythical secret drawer as a huge joke.</p>

<p>“Laugh at me if you want to. When I find it,
then it will be <em>my</em> turn to laugh at <em>you</em>,” Mabel
emphasized.</p>

<p>“<em>When</em> you do, we’ll stand in line and let you
laugh at us,” jeered Eleanor.</p>

<p>“I’ll remember that,” retorted her sister. “I’m
going to the sitting-room now to patiently pursue
my indefatigable investigations. Ahem! ‘Never
despair’ is my motto.”</p>

<p>“‘Sleep, sweetly sleep,’ is going to be mine,”
yawned Eleanor. “I’m going to take a nap.”</p>

<p>“I’d <em>like</em> to go down to the orange groves.”
Patsy beamed significantly upon Beatrice. “I’m
not supposed to trail around this vast tract of
terrestrial territory alone. If some one will
kindly volunteer&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I’ll take pity on you,” laughed Bee. “Come
on. While we’re about it we might as well lug a
basket along and fill it with oranges. ‘Try to be
useful as well as ornamental.’ That’s <em>my</em> motto.”</p>

<p>“Mine is: ‘Be thankful for small favors,’” retaliated
Patsy with an impish grin. “Allow me
to escort you to the kitchen for the basket. Good-bye,
Perry children. We’ll see you later.”</p>

<p>Patsy offered her arm to Bee with an extravagant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
flourish and the two girls left the room
laughing. Mabel promptly made a bee-line for
the sitting-room, while Eleanor went to her own
room for her nap.</p>

<p>Bee and Patsy spent an enjoyable but uneventful
hour in the orange groves, returning
with their basket piled high with luscious fruit.
Mindful of her intent to have first audience with
her father on his return that afternoon, Patsy
posted herself on a balcony overlooking the drive
to watch for him.</p>

<p>When, at five o’clock, he drove the car up the
drive, he was met halfway to the house by his
daughter who imperiously demanded a ride to the
garage.</p>

<p>Informed of all that had recently occurred and
the course of action Patsy had laid out for him,
Mr. Carroll looked decidedly grave.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry to hear this of Carlos,” he said. “So
far as work goes, he’s an excellent man. I’m
going to adopt your suggestion, Patsy, to say
nothing to him at present about this ghost business.
I’ll explain to your Aunt Martha so that
she’ll be satisfied to let matters stand as they
are. Of course, if he continues to stir up trouble
among the maids or my black boys by frightening
them with ridiculous yarns about ghosts, then I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
shall feel obliged to come down on him for it.”</p>

<p>“Have you asked him yet about either old
Rosita or Dolores?”</p>

<p>Having related to her father all she knew of
both, Patsy now referred to them by name.</p>

<p>“Yes.” Mr. Carroll smiled. “I described
them to him this morning and inquired about
them. He had nothing to say beyond that this
Rosita was his grandmother and not insane. He
swears that he never saw this girl Dolores.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe him,” Patsy said with a vigorous
shake of her auburn head. “She has lived
in this neighborhood several years. She told me
so. He was brought up here. He must have
seen her often. He’s a Spanish-speaking Mexican
and she’s Spanish. He must certainly know
who she is. Why he should deny knowing her I
can’t imagine. Just the same, it’s something I
intend to find out, if only for my own satisfaction.”</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII<br />
<span class="smaller">SOMETHING!</span></h2>

<p>“There’s to be a Venetian fête on Lake
Worth on Thursday evening. Would
you like to attend it?”</p>

<p>Mr. Carroll made this announcement at the
breakfast table one Monday morning to an interested
group of listeners. A week had elapsed
since the eventful morning on which Patsy had
made the acquaintance of Dolores and the Wayfarers
had returned from the beach in time to
witness the departure of ghost-ridden Mammy
Luce.</p>

<p>On the following morning they had gone, accompanied
by Miss Carroll, to keep tryst with
their wood nymph at the spot she had designated.
As Patsy had predicted, her chums immediately
succumbed to the charm of the little Spanish girl.</p>

<p>Even Miss Martha had no fault to find with
her so far as behavior went. She found the young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
girl neither ill-bred nor uncouth. Instead, Dolores
exhibited toward stately Miss Carroll a shy
deference that would have impressed in her favor
a far more critical judge.</p>

<p>What Miss Martha did not quite like, however,
was Dolores’ wistful but absolutely firm refusal
to reveal where she lived or with whom she lived.</p>

<p>“I would to answer and thus please you,” she
had sadly said, lifting bright, brave eyes to meet
squarely those of her dignified questioner. “I
would to make you the visit to Las Golondrinas
and thus be made so happy. I cannot. It is forbidden.”</p>

<p>At the conclusion of the interview they had left
her standing under the fronded green of the palmettos,
hands crossed over her breast, dark eyes
eloquent with longing. Before they parted from
her, however, Patsy obtained her reluctant promise
to come to them on the beach for a few minutes,
at least, whenever she chanced to see the
Wayfarers bathing there.</p>

<p>Two mornings afterward she had kept her
word. With her she had brought the blue book,
voicing eager praise of the “very sweet story” and
her thanks for the “<i lang="es">simpatica</i>” letter. Though
the Wayfarers had pressed her to stay, she remained
with them but a few moments. During<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
that time she had cast frequent timid glances toward
the jungle as though in lively fear of something
or someone known to herself alone.</p>

<p>Unable to withstand Patsy’s coaxing plea of:
“Come again to-morrow morning and I’ll have
another nice story book here for you,” she had
paid them a brief call on the next day. Since that
time she had not again appeared on the beach at
their bathing hour, and the Wayfarers did considerable
wondering as to what had become of
her.</p>

<p>The past three days having, therefore, been
particularly uneventful beyond the healthy pleasures
of outdoors, the four girls now hailed Mr.
Carroll’s proposal with acclamation.</p>

<p>“What is a Venetian fête?” inquired Bee.
“It’s held on the water. I know that much.
What do we have to do? Do we dress in fancy
costumes?”</p>

<p>“Only the boats dress up in fancy costumes at
Venetian fêtes, Bee,” informed Patsy, laughing.
“We wear our best bib and tucker, of course, and
sail around in a motor launch or some kind of
boat that’s all decorated with Chinese lanterns,
colored lights, etc. Am I right, Dad?”</p>

<p>“Right-o,” smiled Mr. Carroll. “As it happens,
your fairy bark awaits you. I’ve engaged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
a power boat for the evening. Had a hard time
getting hold of it, too. We’ll run the car down
to the beach during the afternoon of Thursday.
I’ll have the lanterns and festoonings aboard the
launch and you girls can spend the time before
dinner decorating it. How will that suit you?”</p>

<p>The loud babble of appreciation that arose
caused Mr. Carroll playfully to put his hands
over his ears.</p>

<p>“My, what a noisy crowd!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>“We’re only trying to express our all-around
joyfulness,” Patsy defended. “You wouldn’t
have liked it a bit if we had just said primly,
‘How nice!’ We believe in noise and lots of it.”</p>

<p>“So I’ve noticed,” was the pertinent retort.
“Well, I’m glad you’re pleased. You’ll have to
excuse me now. I’ve an engagement with a man
at ten at the Ponciana. I must be hiking.”</p>

<p>“Really, Robert, I haven’t had a chance to utter
a sound since you told us about the fête,”
came plaintively from Miss Martha, though her
eyes twinkled. As a matter of fact she had purposely
kept silent, allowing the Wayfarers to
bubble forth their jubilation uninterrupted. “Do
you consider this boat you’ve engaged perfectly
safe? I hope you know how to run it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I sha’n’t run it. The man from whom I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
rented it will be on hand to do that. It’s absolutely
safe, so don’t worry, Martha, but make up
your mind to enjoy yourself.”</p>

<p>With this assurance, Mr. Carroll hastily departed.
After he had gone the others lingered
at table, further to discuss the prospective pleasure
in store for them.</p>

<p>“I wish we could take Dolores with us,” Patsy
said generously. “She’d love the fête. If only
we could coax her to go she could wear one of
my gowns. Maybe she’ll be at the beach this
morning. If she is, I’m going to tease her good
and hard to go with us. You wouldn’t mind,
would you, Auntie?”</p>

<p>“No. Invite her if you choose. I don’t doubt
she would behave as well as the rest of you,” Miss
Carroll placidly opined. “If she should accept
(I doubt it), you must make her understand,
Patsy, that she will have to appear in one of your
gowns, not to mention pumps and hose. We
shall probably meet a number of persons we
know at Palm Beach.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that part of it will be all right,” Patsy
answered with the supreme confidence of one
who can remove mountains. “It’s whether she’ll
promise to go that’s bothering me.”</p>

<p>Greatly to the disappointment of the Wayfarers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
Dolores did not appear on the beach that
morning. Nor did they see any signs of her on
the next day or the next. Thursday morning did
not bring her to the sands.</p>

<p>On the way back to the house from the beach
the party even went so far as to visit the spot in
the jungle which Dolores had claimed as her own
special nook. But she was not there. Though
the girls called out her name repeatedly in their
fresh young voices, only the twitter of the birds
and the sighing of the light breeze among the
leaves answered them. Dolores had evidently
forsaken her forest haunt for a time at least.</p>

<p>“Very likely that horrible ‘she’ is keeping Dolores
in and making her work,” grumbled Patsy
to Bee when the party finally returned to the
road and started for the house. “You know, Dolores
told me that she had had to do very hard
work ever since she came here to live after her
father died. It’s too bad Dad has been so busy
lately. We can’t go to see those fisher folks until
he can find time to go with us. I do wish
Auntie would allow us to go there by ourselves.
We could walk straight up the beach and never
come to a bit of harm.”</p>

<p>“Well, she won’t, so we might as well be resigned,”
replied Bee ruefully. “She’s right, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
course. My mother would feel the same about
it; so would Mrs. Perry.”</p>

<p>“I know it. I’m not complaining of Aunt
Martha. She’s as good as gold. She’s been perfectly
angelic about Dolores. Auntie isn’t the
least tiny bit snobbish. She and Dad are alike in
that.”</p>

<p>Returned to the house before noon the Wayfarers
lunched early. Luncheon over, they dutifully
obeyed Miss Carroll’s mandate to retire to
their rooms for a brief siesta before dressing for
the fête. Mr. Carroll’s parting injunction to
them that morning had been:</p>

<p>“I’ll have the car at the door at three-thirty
sharp. Be ready to hop into it, girls. The earlier
we arrive at Palm Beach, the more time you’ll
have before dinner to decorate the launch.”</p>

<p>Three-thirty not only found the car on the
drive at the entrance to the patio, it also saw
Miss Martha being helped into it by her brother.
She was followed by the Wayfarers, all looking
their best in their smart summer finery. The
four girls were in exuberant spirits as one after
another they skipped nimbly into the automobile.
The Venetian fête promised to be an item
of pleasant variation on their program of enjoyment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>The drive to Palm Beach was, as always, a
delightful one. Coming at last to the famous
shell road the car followed it for a short distance.
Presently the yachting party arrived at
the point on the lagoon where their boat was
docked.</p>

<p>Boarding it in a flutter of happy anticipation,
the Wayfarers temporarily hid the glory of their
dainty frocks under substantial gingham pinafores
which they had purposely brought along.</p>

<p>Then the engrossing occupation of dressing-up
their boat began. What seemed to the girls an
unlimited supply of gay Chinese lanterns and
bright-hued bunting had been brought aboard
for them to dispose as they fancied. Fore and
aft the enthusiastic toilers strung the lanterns,
and hung the bunting in graceful festoons, until
the trim craft blossomed into a rainbow of color.</p>

<p>“I can hardly wait for it to get dark!” exclaimed
Mabel. “With all these lanterns glowing
and those strings of little electric lights winking
all colors, our boat’s going to be simply
gorgeous.”</p>

<p>“I hope we’ll have some simply gorgeous eats
for dinner,” was Patsy’s unaesthetic but heartfelt
yearning. “I’m terribly hungry. I hope,
too, that we sha’n’t bump against a lot of people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
Auntie and I know the minute we walk into the
hotel. I want to gobble my dinner in a hurry
and get back here before dark so as to see everything
that goes on.”</p>

<p>Patsy’s fervent hopes met with a realization
that pleased her not a little. The “eats,” which
consisted in an elaborate course dinner, were
quite “gorgeous” enough to evoke her pronounced
approval. More, the diners encountered none
they knew among the endless succession of people
strolling in and out of the vast dining-room.
Neither in the imposing foyer of the great
hotel, on the veranda or under the colonnade did
they spy a single familiar face. It was as though
they had stepped into a world of easy-going
strangers, all bent on extracting the same amount
of pleasure out of life as themselves.</p>

<p>Dinner eaten they lingered for a while on one
of the hotel’s many verandas which overlooked
magnificent gardens, aglow with fragrant tropical
blooms.</p>

<p>Just before dark they drove again to the lagoon
and were presently aboard their launch,
watching with eager eyes the beauty of the scene.
Everywhere the scented dusk was pierced by
winking, multi-colored lights. They dotted the
wall of the lagoon and sprang up from hundreds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
of craft, large and small, which plied the lake’s
placid waters.</p>

<p>From off shore came the singing overtones of
violins, proceeding from an orchestra stationed
under the colonnade of a not far distant hotel.
Now and then their ears caught the tinkle of
mandolins mingled with care-free voices raised in
song. Across the still waters occasional shouts
rose above the harmony of sound, as gay occupants
of boats hailed passing craft and were
hailed in return.</p>

<p>As it grew darker, rockets began to hiss skyward,
lighting up the lagoon into greater beauty
and revealing white-clad groups of spectators
sauntering along the shell road or resting on the
sea wall.</p>

<p>With the ascent of the first rocket, boat after
boat rushed off across the water to join the rapidly
forming carnival procession which would,
when completely formed, circle the lake. Presently
came a fan-fare of trumpets, a burst of
music from many bands playing in unison, and
the procession started on its way around the
lake, gliding along like a huge, glowing serpent.</p>

<p>The Wayfarers thought it great fun to be an
actual part of that fairy-like pageant. As the
majority of the occupants of other boats were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
lifting up their voices in song, the four girls sang,
too. Patsy’s clear, high soprano voice led off in
a boat song with which her companions were familiar.
After that they sang everything they
could remember from “Sailing” to “Auld Lang
Syne.”</p>

<p>Later, when the boats began dropping out of
line, their launch also left the procession and
scudded farther out on the lake to a point from
where its lively passengers could obtain a more
satisfying view of the gorgeous spectacle.</p>

<p>There they lingered for some time, well content
to breathe in the flower-perfumed night air,
listen to the frequent bursts of harmonious sound
that drifted to their ears, and watch the firefly
boats as they darted here and there on the bosom
of fair Lake Worth.</p>

<p>It was well toward eleven o’clock when the
launch docked at her pier and the voyagers went
ashore to where their automobile awaited them.
Followed a short drive to one of the great hotels,
where the party stopped for a late supper, then
took the homeward road through the balmy darkness
of the tropical night.</p>

<p>Midnight came and went and one o’clock drew
on before a happy but sleepy company made port
at Las Golondrinas.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>“Go straight to bed, girls,” commanded Miss
Martha as she marshalled the small procession of
drowsy revelers down the echoing corridors to
their rooms. “Don’t sit up to talk. You can do
that to-morrow morning.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to talk. I want to sleep,” assured
Eleanor with a yawn. “If Mab tries to
talk to me after I’m in bed, I’ll rise in my might
and put her out of the room.”</p>

<p>“See that <em>you</em> don’t talk to <em>me</em>,” warned Mabel.
“If you do, <em>you</em> may find yourself wandering
around in the corridor until morning.”</p>

<p>“Glad we’re of the same mind,” giggled Eleanor.
“Our chances for sleep seem to be good.”</p>

<p>“Don’t worry about <em>me</em>, Aunt Martha,” Patsy
declared, as, her arm in Bee’s, the two girls halted
at the door of their room. “You won’t hear a
sound from Bee or me after we’ve put out our
light. Here’s my very nicest good-night kiss,
dear. We’ve all had a wonderful evening and
we’re ready to subside until morning without a
murmur.”</p>

<p>Shut in their room, Patsy and Bee beamed
sleepily at each other and went about their preparations
for bed in commendable silence, broken
now and then by a soft exchange of remarks pertaining
to the evening’s entertainment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>Lights out shortly became the order of things
with them. Almost as soon as their heads touched
the pillow they were off and away to dreamland.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There comes sometimes to a peaceful dreamer
a curious sense of impending danger which breaks
through the curtain of slumber and arouses the
sleep-drugged faculties to alert wakefulness.</p>

<p>Just how long she had slept, Patsy had no definite
idea. She knew only that she was sitting up
in bed, broad awake, her horrified eyes staring
at something tall and white which stood in the
center of the moonlight-flooded room.</p>

<p>She tried to cry out, but her voice was gone.
She could only gaze, half paralyzed with terror,
at the fearsome white shape. For a moment it
remained there, a shapeless, immovable thing of
dread.</p>

<p>Suddenly, it raised a long, white-swathed arm
in a menacing gesture toward the trembling girl
in the big four-poster bed. It took one sliding
step forward.</p>

<p>Patsy succeeded in uttering a desperate, choking
sound, intended for a shout. One groping
hand reached over and found Bee.</p>

<p>The dread apparition came no nearer the bed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
than the length of that one sliding step. It halted
briefly, turned, then glided to the half-opened
door and vanished into the corridor.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX<br />
<span class="smaller">PATSY’S SCHEME</span></h2>

<p>“Bee, wake up! Oh, please wake up!”</p>

<p>Patsy had not only regained her voice,
but the use of her arms as well. Hands
on Bee’s shoulders, she now shook her companion
gently in an effort to waken her.</p>

<p>“What&mdash;y-e-s,” Bee mumbled, then opened her
eyes.</p>

<p>In the moonlight she could see Patsy quite
clearly as her chum sat crouched at her side.
Blinking wonderingly up at Patsy, Bee began
dimly to realize that something unusual must
have happened.</p>

<p>“What is it, Patsy? Are you sick?” she anxiously
questioned, sitting up in bed with apprehensive
energy.</p>

<p>“No; I’m not sick. I’m scared. I saw it, Bee.
I woke up all of a sudden and saw it standing in
the middle of the room.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>“Saw what?”</p>

<p>“The ghost; Mammy Luce’s ‘sperrit,’” Patsy
returned solemnly.</p>

<p>“You’ve been dreaming, Patsy, dear.” Beatrice
dropped a reassuring arm about Patsy’s
shoulders.</p>

<p>“No, Bee. I wasn’t dreaming. I was as wide
awake as I am now when I saw it. I tell you it
woke me from a sound sleep. It didn’t make a
sound. Just the same it woke me. I wish now
that I’d been brave enough to climb out of bed
and follow it. But I wasn’t. It frightened me
so I couldn’t move or speak.”</p>

<p>“What was it? What did you see?”</p>

<p>Bee had now become convinced that Patsy had
not been dreaming.</p>

<p>“I saw a figure standing right there,” Patsy
pointed. “I can’t tell you what it looked like except
that it was just an enormous white shape.
I tried to call you, but I couldn’t. I did manage
to sit up in bed. It raised a long, white arm and
started toward me. Then I tried again and made
a sort of sound and reached out to you. It didn’t
come any nearer. It turned and went out the
door. It must have come in that way, for the
door stood half open. It was closed when we
went to bed. You remember that. Now I believe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
that Mammy Luce saw what I saw. No
wonder it frightened her. It frightened me, too,
and I don’t believe in ghosts.”</p>

<p>“Well,” Bee drew a long, sighing breath,
“whatever you and Mammy Luce saw was not
a <em>ghost</em>. Make up your mind to that. It was a
real, live person <em>playing</em> ghost. You and I,
Patsy, must find out who it is and why the person
is doing it. This ghost business has begun, all of
a sudden. Nothing of the kind appeared when
we first came here. There’s a motive behind it
that we’ve got to discover.”</p>

<p>“What can it be?” wondered Patsy. Her
brief terror had now given place to curiosity.
“Someone might be trying to play a practical
joke on us. But who? Not the maids or Dad’s
black boys or&mdash;&mdash;” Patsy stopped. “Bee, do
you suppose it could be&mdash;<em>Carlos</em>?” she asked with
a little gasp. “The figure looked too tall and
broad to be <em>him</em>.”</p>

<p>“Still it might be.” Bee had avidly seized
upon Patsy’s sudden inspiration. “Draped in a
sheet, he’d look ever so much taller and bigger.
It was he who told Mammy Luce about the
ghost, you know.”</p>

<p>“But why should Carlos want to do such a
despicable thing? We’ve never done him an injury.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
Why, we never even <em>spoke</em> to him except
on that one morning when we tried to get him to
tell us about Las Golondrinas.”</p>

<p>“We can’t possibly know <em>yet</em> what his object
may be. We may be doing him a wrong by suspecting
him. Just the same, he’s the only person
we have any reason to suspect.”</p>

<p>“He might have done it to get even with us
because Mab asked him if Rosita was crazy. I’ve
always heard that Latins are very vengeful.”</p>

<p>Racking her agile brain for a motive, Patsy
now advanced this theory.</p>

<p>“Let’s go back a little farther,” replied Bee.
“Carlos is old Rosita’s grandson. Rosita must
hate us or she wouldn’t have called us names and
treated us as she did. Granted, <em>she</em> hates us.
Maybe Carlos hates us, too. We know he doesn’t
like us. He showed us that much and very
plainly.”</p>

<p>Bee paused, mentally trying to fit Patsy’s
theory to her own.</p>

<p>“There’s more to it than spite because Mab
asked Carlos whether Rosita was crazy,” she continued
reflectively. “Now I believe I begin to
see. Neither Carlos nor Rosita wants us to live
here. Why wouldn’t that account for this ghost
affair? Carlos might have done it to scare us,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
believing we wouldn’t stay in a haunted house.
He frightened Mammy Luce out of here. I’m
sure if Emily or Celia had seen&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Bee’s low-toned discourse was suddenly interrupted
by a wild shriek of mortal terror from
somewhere below stairs. It floated up to the two
girls through the half-open door, echoing and
re-echoing through the corridors. It was followed
by a succession of shrieks, each rising a
trifle higher than the preceding one.</p>

<p>“Come on.”</p>

<p>Leaping out of bed, Bee snatched her kimono
from a nearby chair, slipped her arms into it and
darted, bare-footed, from the room.</p>

<p>Patsy was only an instant behind her. As the
two dashed madly along the corridor and downstairs,
the sound of opening doors and alarmed
voices was heard. That eerie, piercing scream
could hardly have failed to rouse the entire household.
By the time three frightened women and
one considerably startled man had reached their
doors and opened them, Patsy and Bee were out
of sight.</p>

<p>Straight for the servants’ quarters at the rear
of the house the valiant runners headed. Their
mad dash received a most unexpected check. A
door suddenly opened. A figure bounced into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
the narrow hallway just in time to collide violently
with the advancing duo. A new succession
of frenzied yells rent the air, accompanied
by a resounding thump as rescuers and rescued
went down in a heap.</p>

<p>“Oh, lawsy, lawsy!” moaned a voice. “Oh,
please, Massa ghos’, I ain’t done nothin’.”</p>

<p>A prostrate form swathed in a brilliant pink
calico night gown writhed on the floor. Above
it, Bee and Patsy, now on their feet, stood clinging
to each other, speechless with laughter.</p>

<p>“Get&mdash;up&mdash;Celia!” gasped Patsy. “We&mdash;we&mdash;aren’t&mdash;ghosts.
Oh, Bee!”</p>

<p>Patsy went off into another fit of laughter.</p>

<p>Somewhat calmed by the sound of a familiar
voice, Celia raised her head. In the pale light
shed by a bracket lamp she now recognized
“Missie Patsy.” Very slowly, and a trifle sheepishly,
she scrambled to her feet.</p>

<p>By this time Mr. Carroll, Miss Martha, Mab
and Eleanor had reached the scene of action.</p>

<p>“What on earth is the matter, Celia?” demanded
Mr. Carroll. “Was that you we heard
screaming? What’s happened to you?”</p>

<p>“I done gwine t’ tell yoh in a minute.”</p>

<p>Overcome by the awful realization that she was
not suitably clothed for the occasion, Celia made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
a wild dive into her room and banged the door.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the door of the next room had
opened just enough to allow a chocolate-colored
head to peer forth.</p>

<p>“Celie she done see the ghos’,” explained Emily.
“I jes’ lock myself in so I done be safe. It
am gone now.”</p>

<p>“Naturally. No self-respecting ghost could
stand such a racket as I heard,” dryly declared
Mr. Carroll. “Now tell me about this so-called
ghost. What does Celia think she saw?”</p>

<p>“I done <em>seen</em> it!”</p>

<p>Celia now reappeared, wrapped from chin to
toes in the ample folds of a striped summer
blanket. Not being the proud possessor of a
kimono, she had chosen the blanket as most highly
suitable to her present needs.</p>

<p>“I was dreaming nice as anything’, ’bout a gran’
ball I was gittin’ ready foah,” she blurted forth.
“Suddin’ like I wakes up ’case I done feel suthin’
cold on my face. It war an ole cold dead hand
and a whoppin’ big white ghos’ was bendin’ over
me. I lets out a yell, ’case I was skairt to die an’
it jes’ laffs terrible like an’ floats right out the
doah. I’m gwine away from heah the minute it
gits daylight. I ain’t gwine to live no moah in
this place. I reckon I know now what was ailin’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
Mammy Luce. She done seen it, too, same’s
me.”</p>

<p>Celia having thus put two and two together
and announced her departure, it became Miss
Martha’s task to endeavor to soothe and cajole
the badly-scared maid to reconsider her decision.
Her efforts were not a success. Neither did the
added coaxing of the Wayfarers have any effect.
Celia remained firm in her resolve. Emily,
however, was made of firmer stuff. She stoutly
reiterated her disbelief in “ghos’es” and, much to
Miss Martha’s relief, declared her intent to “stick
it out, ’case no ghos’ ain’t gwine to git me.”</p>

<p>In the end, a much disturbed party, consisting
of five women and one man, repaired to the sitting-room
for a consultation.</p>

<p>During the excitement both Beatrice and
Patsy had deemed it wise to say nothing, while
in the presence of the maids, of what Patsy herself
had seen.</p>

<p>As they were about to go upstairs, Patsy
whispered to Bee: “Don’t say a word about&mdash;well,
you know. I’ll tell you why, later.”</p>

<p>“Robert,” began Miss Martha severely, when
the little company had settled themselves in the
sitting-room, “I insist now on your speaking to
that Carlos man of yours about this ghost story<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
he told Mammy Luce. Someone is evidently trying
to play practical jokes upon the servants. I
believe he knows something about it. It may be
he who is doing it.”</p>

<p>“That can’t be. Only yesterday morning Carlos
asked me for two days off. His brother, in
Miami, died and he felt it his duty to go there to
console the family and attend the funeral. So
you see he had nothing to do with to-night’s affair.
It’s more likely one of my black boys has
done a little ghost walking just to be funny.
You notice that no one except the servants has
been visited by apparitions.”</p>

<p>“There is no telling how soon the rest of us
may be startled half out of our senses,” acidly
reminded Miss Martha. “You had better hire a
guard to patrol the grounds around the house at
night. He ought to be able to catch this scamp
who has frightened the servants.”</p>

<p>“I’ll do it,” promised Mr. Carroll. “I’ll have
a plain clothes man from Palm Beach up here
to-morrow evening. He’ll stay here, too, until
we catch the rascal who is causing all this commotion.”</p>

<p>“And will you speak to Carlos?” persisted
Miss Carroll. “I am more suspicious of him than
of your blacks.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>“As soon as he comes back,” reassured her
brother.</p>

<p>The serious part of the discussion having come
to an end, Mabel and Eleanor hurled a volley of
eager questions at Bee and Patsy concerning
what had happened before they reached the hallway.
Patsy therewith proceeded to convulse her
hearers with a description of Bee’s and her own
untimely collision with Celia. Mabel giggled
herself almost hysterical and had to be playfully
shaken into sobriety by Eleanor, who declared
that the ghost walk had gone to Mab’s head.</p>

<p>The will to sleep overcoming their dread of
living midnight visitants in ghostly garments,
the ways and means committee adjourned in
favor of rest. As a last word, Miss Martha cautioned
the Wayfarers to lock their doors, which
had hitherto been allowed to remain unlocked.</p>

<p>“I don’t know whether it was exactly fair not
to tell Auntie about my seeing the ghost,” was
Patsy’s first remark to Bee after they had regained
their room. “It’s like this, Bee. I’ve
thought of a plan I’d like to try. I have an idea
the ghost will come back and I’m going to be
ready for it. If Auntie knew that I’d actually
seen it, she’d probably have our bed moved into
her room. Mab and Nellie’s room is almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
across the corridor from hers, you know. We’re
farther away, so she’d worry if she knew what
we know. I’m going to tell her sometime, of
course, but not now. Will you stand by me, Bee,
and help me catch the ghost?”</p>

<p>“I will,” vowed Beatrice, too much carried
away by the scheme to reflect that she and Patsy
were perhaps pitting themselves against a dangerous
opponent. “Do you believe, Patsy, that
Carlos really has gone away?”</p>

<p>“No; I don’t. I think Carlos is the ghost,”
calmly asserted Patsy. “Furthermore, he knows
a way to get into this house that we don’t. All
the men in Florida sent to guard Las Golondrinas
won’t catch him. When Dad spoke of getting
a guard, I had half a mind to speak up about
seeing the ghost. Then I decided not to. I
wanted to see what we could do by ourselves.”</p>

<p>“What <em>are</em> we going to do? You said you had
a plan.”</p>

<p>“I have. I’m going to lasso the ghost,” Patsy
announced with a boyish grin. “I learned to
handle a lariat when I was out West three years
ago visiting Pauline Barry. One of the cowboys
on her father’s ranch taught me the way to
do it. There’s a coil of light, thin, tough rope in
the stable. I saw it the other day. That’s going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
to be my lariat. I’ll smuggle it up here and practice
with it. This is such a big room I can swing
it easily in here.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see how you can carry out that plan,”
was Bee’s doubting answer. “How can you possibly
know when the ghost is going to appear?
Besides, you mayn’t have time, perhaps, or a
chance to do any lassoing.”</p>

<p>“That’s the only hard part of it. You and I
will have to take turns sitting up and watching,
Bee. Suppose we go to bed at eleven o’clock, as
we usually do. Well, from eleven until two I’ll
sit up and watch. From two until five it will be
your turn. After five no ghost will be silly
enough to walk. I’ll take the part of the night
when it’s more likely to appear, because I know
how to swing the lariat. If it appears during
your watch&mdash;&mdash;Let me see. I guess I’d better
teach you how to lasso. No; that won’t do. It
takes a long time to learn the trick. You’d be
apt to miss the ghost. Then we’d never catch
it.”</p>

<p>“I think we’d both better sit up until a little
after two for a few nights,” proposed Bee. “If
we’re sleepy the next day we can take a nap. It
was just about two this morning when the ghost
came. If Carlos <em>is</em> the ghost, he may appear to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
your aunt or Mab and Nellie another time and
not come near us. If he’s trying to scare us away
from here, that’s what he’d be apt to do.”</p>

<p>“He may have wandered into their rooms, too,
for all we know, only they didn’t happen to wake
up and see him,” surmised Patsy. “There’s only
a bare chance that anything will come of it, but
it will be exciting to try out our plan for a few
nights while it’s bright moonlight. Our scheme
wouldn’t work during the dark of the moon.
Now while the moon’s full you can see for yourself
how light it makes this room. Then, too, a
big white ghost is an easy mark,” finished Patsy
with a giggle.</p>

<p>“All right, Patsy. I pledge myself to become
a valiant ghost catcher,” laughed Bee. “Now
let’s go bye-bye or we’ll never be able to sit up
to-morrow night. The only thing that bothers
me is not telling your aunt.”</p>

<p>Bee had begun to feel a belated twinge of conscience.</p>

<p>“It bothers me, too,” admitted Patsy, “but I’m
going to stifle my conscience for a few days. If
nothing remarkable happens, then we’ll go to
Auntie and confess and let her scold us as much
as she pleases.”</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX<br />
<span class="smaller">THE WAY THE SCHEME WORKED OUT</span></h2>

<p>The next morning witnessed the departure
of Celia, bag and baggage. Aside
from that one item of interest, nothing
occurred that day to disturb the peace of the
household of Las Golondrinas. With Emily now
installed as cook and a very good cook, at that,
the loss of Celia’s services was not so vital, particularly
as Emily’s sister, Jennie, had promised
her services the following week.</p>

<p>What signally worried and annoyed Miss Martha,
however, was Mr. Carroll’s regretful announcement
at dinner that evening to the effect
that he would not be able to obtain the services
of a guard for at least three days. An unusually
large number of private details had rendered
headquarters short of men used for such duty,
he explained.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry, Martha, but it can’t be helped,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
he consoled. “I’d turn the job over to one of my
black boys, but it wouldn’t be advisable. If one
of them has really been playing ghost, depend
upon it, the others know it. Result, the ghost
wouldn’t appear. He’d be warned to lie low.
I’ll stay up myself to-night and watch, if you feel
in the least afraid. Say the word and I’ll stand
guard.”</p>

<p>“Certainly not,” promptly vetoed his sister.
“I’m not <em>afraid</em>. I merely wish this disagreeable
foolishness stopped. We will lock our doors and
barricade them, if necessary. As for the windows
opening onto the patio, I hardly know what to
do. It’s not healthful to sleep with closed windows.
They are so high from the floor of the
patio, a ghost, or rather this idiotic person who
is playing ghost, would find it hard work to climb
up to them. We may as well leave them open.”</p>

<p>“We can set rows of tinware on the inner edge
of the window sills in such a way that a touch
would upset the whole business. If anyone tries
to climb in a window, all the pots and pans will
fall into the room with a grand crash and wake
us up,” proposed Mabel. “Besides, the ghost
won’t linger after such a rattle and bang.”</p>

<p>“A good idea,” approved Miss Carroll solemnly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>Eleanor, Bee and Patsy received it with laughter
in which Mr. Carroll joined.</p>

<p>“We’d better make a raid on the kitchen and
select our tinware,” said Eleanor gaily. “I’m
proud to have such a resourceful sister. There’s
nothing like getting ready for his ghostship.”</p>

<p>“I don’t imagine you’ll be troubled to-night
by spectral intruders,” Mr. Carroll said seriously.
“Such a thing is hardly likely to occur two nights
in succession.”</p>

<p>“Emily’s not afraid, that’s certain,” declared
Beatrice. “She’s going to sleep all alone downstairs
to-night. She says she’s ‘not gwine to git
skairt of no ghos’.’”</p>

<p>“I told her she might sleep in that little room
at the end of the portrait gallery, but she said she
preferred her own room,” commented Miss Martha.
“I am agreeably surprised to find her not
in the least cowardly or superstitious. It’s fortunate
for us.”</p>

<p>“She told me she was going to lock her door
and her windows and sleep with a club and a
big bottle of ammonia beside her bed,” informed
Patsy. “If the ghost comes she’s going to give
him a warm reception.”</p>

<p>“We all seem to be planning for the ghost’s
welfare,” chuckled Mabel. “Poor ghost. If he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
knows when he’s well off he’ll stay away from
here to-night.”</p>

<p>Much open discussion of the spectral visitor
had served to rob the idea of its original horror.
Instead of a serious menace to tranquillity the
ghost was rapidly becoming a joke.</p>

<p>“We’ve done a little secret preparing of our
own,” boasted Patsy in a whisper to Bee as they
strolled out of the dining room, arms twined
about each other’s waists.</p>

<p>True to her determination, Patsy had slipped
down to the stable that morning, commandeered
the desired coil of rope and successfully smuggled
it into her room. That afternoon, while
Mabel and Eleanor were taking a walk about
the grounds with Miss Carroll, the two conspirators
locked their door and proceeded to test out
the most important feature of their plan.</p>

<p>Patsy found the thin, tough rope admirable
for her purpose. The sleeping room, spacious and
square, also lent itself to her plan. The bed being
in one corner left ample room for a free casting
of the lariat. With the quaint mahogany
center table moved back against the wall, she had
a clear field.</p>

<p>For an hour Bee patiently allowed herself to
be lassoed, moving from point to point, thereby<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
to test Patsy’s skill. She soon discovered that
her chum was an adept at the art. Wonderfully
quick of movement and sure of aim, Patsy never
failed to land the noose over her head, letting it
drop below her shoulders and drawing it taut
about her arms with almost incredible swiftness.
At the conclusion of the practice both agreed
that the ghost’s chances were small against
“Lariat Patsy,” as Bee laughingly nicknamed
her.</p>

<p>Despite their numerous jests concerning the
ghost, the Wayfarers’ hearts beat a trifle faster
that night as they went to their rooms. Earlier
in the evening the kitchen had been raided and
amid much mirthful comment a goodly supply of
tin and agate ware had been selected and carried
upstairs for window decorations.</p>

<p>Patsy and Bee took part in these preparations
merely, as Patsy confided to her chum, “for
the looks of things.” Both considered their own
private scheme as much more likely to bear fruit.</p>

<p>On retiring to their room for the night the door
was dutifully locked. For half an hour the two
sat talking with the lamps burning, waiting for
the house to grow absolutely quiet. At ten minutes
to twelve, Patsy brought forth the lariat
from its hiding place in her trunk. Next, both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
girls slipped out of their white frocks only to don
dark gowns which would not betray their presence
in the room to the nocturnal intruder they
were planning to receive.</p>

<p>“Shall I put out the lights?” whispered Bee.</p>

<p>“Yes. Then stand in that space opposite the
door and see if I can rope you,” breathed Patsy.</p>

<p>Quickly Bee extinguished the two oil bracket
lamps and a large oil lamp that stood on a pedestal
in a corner. Into the room the moonlight
poured whitely, lighting it fairly well except in
the corners.</p>

<p>“All ready?” softly questioned Patsy, moving
back toward the end of the room farthest from
the door.</p>

<p>“Yes,” came the sibilant whisper.</p>

<p>An instant and Patsy had made a successful
cast.</p>

<p>“It works splendidly,” she softly exulted.
“Lets try it again.”</p>

<p>A few more trials of her prowess and she was
satisfied to recoil the rope and sit down on the bed
beside Bee.</p>

<p>“It’s time to unlock the door, Bee,” she murmured
as the chime of midnight rang faintly on
their ears from a tall clock at the end of the
corridor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>“All right.”</p>

<p>Bee rose, tiptoed softly to the door and turned
the key. Stealing back across the room she took
up her position of vigilance a few feet from
Patsy, seating herself upon a little low stool.</p>

<p>Patsy had posted herself on the edge of her
trunk, lariat coiled, ready to spring into action
at a moments notice. Over the house now hung
the uncanny silence of midnight, so tense in its
stillness that the two watchers could hear each
other breathe.</p>

<p>For the first half hour neither experienced any
Special discomfort. By the time that one o’clock
had come and gone, both were beginning to feel
the strain of sitting absolutely still in one position.</p>

<p>The distant note of the half hour found them
weary, but holding their ground. Patsy was
worse off than Bee. Bee could relax, at least a
little, while she had to sit on the extreme edge of
her trunk, constantly on the alert. Should their
expected visitor enter the room, she must act with
the swiftness of lightning or all their patient
watching would have been in vain.</p>

<p>As she sat there it suddenly occurred to her
how horrified her aunt would be, could she know
what was going on only a few yards from where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
she slumbered so peacefully. Patsy could not
resist giving a soft little chuckle.</p>

<p>“What is it?” whispered Bee.</p>

<p>“Nothing. Tell you to-morrow. I guess we
can go to bed soon.”</p>

<p>“I guess so. It’s almost two o’clock.”</p>

<p>Silence again descended. The clock chimed
three-quarters of the hour. Its plaintive voice
ceased and the hush deepened until it seemed to
Patsy almost too profound for endurance. And
then it was broken by a sound, as of a door being
softly opened.</p>

<p>Bee’s heart nearly skipped a beat as she
listened. Patsy felt the cold chills race up and
down her spine. Two pairs of eyes were now
fastened in strained attention on the door. Was
it opening? Yes, it surely was; slowly, very
slowly. It was open at last! A huge white shape
stood poised on the threshold. It moved forward
with infinite caution. It had halted now, exactly
on the spot where Bee had lately stood while
Patsy tried out her prowess with the lariat.</p>

<p>Over in the corner Patsy was gathering herself
together for the fateful cast. Up from the trunk
she now shot like a steel spring. Through the air
with a faint swishing sound the lariat sped. She
pulled it taut to an accompaniment of the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
blood-curdling shrieks she had ever heard. Next
instant she felt herself being jerked violently
forward.</p>

<p>“Bee!” she shouted desperately. “Take hold.
I’m going!”</p>

<p>Bee sprang for the rope and missed it. Patsy
shot past her across the room, headed for the door.
Stubbornly clinging to the rope, she was bumped
violently against the door casing, dragged
through the doorway and on into the corridor.</p>

<p>As she shot down the stone passageway she was
dimly conscious of doors opening along it and
voices crying out in alarm. On she went, propelled
by that sinister, terrible force ahead. Now
she had bumped around another corner and was
entering the picture gallery. At the ends and in
the center of it bracket lamps burned dimly.</p>

<p>She could see the enormous white shape. It
had paused in the center of the gallery. The relentless
force had slackened. The rope now lay
in loose coils along the gallery. And then something
happened which nearly took Patsy’s breath.</p>

<p>Even in that faint light she saw the picture of
the cavalier move forward. The huge white
shape leaped straight to meet it. The rope began
to move along the floor again. Patsy braced herself
and tightened her grasp on the end she still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
held. Wonder of wonders! The apparition had
disappeared.</p>

<p>Patsy heard an oddly familiar sound. Next
she realized that the savage jerking of the rope
had not begun again. As she stood staring at it,
still clutching it tightly, there began again those
same awful shrieks, mingled with snarls such as
a cornered wild beast might utter.</p>

<p>In the midst of them she was suddenly surrounded
by a frantic little group of persons. She
heard her father saying: “Thank God, she’s
safe!” She felt consciousness slipping from her
like a cloak.</p>

<p>“The rope&mdash;hold the rope,” she mumbled, and
pitched forward into a pair of extended arms.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI<br />
<span class="smaller">THE GHOST</span></h2>

<p>When Patsy came to herself she was
still in the picture gallery. She was
leaning against Miss Martha, who was
engaged in holding smelling salts to her niece’s
nose. To her right clustered Bee, Mabel and
Eleanor, anxious, horror-filled faces fixed upon
her. Back of them stood Emily, her black eyes
rolling, her chocolate-colored features seeming
almost pale in the brighter light the lamps now
gave.</p>

<p>As Patsy’s gray eyes roved dully from one
face to another, she became again alive to sounds
which had assailed her ears at the moment when
consciousness had briefly fled. She was still
hearing those demoniac shrieks, mingled with
savage snarls. Now there was something vaguely
familiar about them. But what? Patsy could
not think.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>“What&mdash;is it?” she stammered. “Where&mdash;is&mdash;it?”</p>

<p>She had begun to realize that the horror she
glimpsed in her companions’ faces had to do with
those same shrieks rather than her own momentary
swoon.</p>

<p>“It’s behind this picture.”</p>

<p>It was her father’s voice that grimly answered
her. He stood at one side of the tarnished gilt
frame, examining a rope. The rope appeared to
spring from halfway down the frame, between
the canvas and the frame itself. It ended in loose
coils, which lay upon the floor of the gallery.</p>

<p>Patsy stared at the picture, from behind which
rose the tumult of horrid sound. For an instant
she listened intently.</p>

<p>“Why&mdash;why&mdash;I know <em>who</em> it is! It’s old
<em>Rosita</em>. I’m <em>sure</em> that’s her voice.”</p>

<p>“So the girls here think,” replied her father.
“Bee tells me <em>you</em> lassoed her.”</p>

<p>Mr. Carroll’s tones conveyed active disapproval
of his daughter’s foolhardy exploit.</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;” began Patsy, then became silent.</p>

<p>“Well, this is not the time to discuss that side
of the affair,” her father continued. “There’s a
secret room or cubby-hole, I don’t know which, behind
the picture. Rosita is in there and can’t get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
out. You attended to her arms, I judge. That’s
the reason for those frenzied howls. Undoubtedly
she’s insane. You’ve had a very narrow escape.”</p>

<p>“How could she get behind the picture without
the use of her arms?” broke in Bee. “There’s a
secret lever to the picture, of course.”</p>

<p>“She may have been able to work it with her
foot,” surmised Mr. Carroll. “Again, she may
have purposely left the door open. There may
be another way out of the place besides this one.
She can’t take it as long as the rope holds. When
the door closed, the rope caught. It’s tough, but
then, the door must have closed with a good deal
of force or it could never have shut on the rope.
She’s trying to break it and can’t. That’s why
she’s in such a rage. We’ve got her, but we must
act quickly. I hate to leave you folks alone here.
Still, I must go for help. I can bring half a
dozen of my black boys here in twenty minutes.
If I could be sure she’d stay as she is now until
I came back&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Mr. Carroll paused, uncertain where his
strongest duty lay.</p>

<p>“I will go for the help, <i lang="es">señor</i>,” suddenly announced
a soft voice.</p>

<p>Absorbed in contemplation of the problem
which confronted them, no one of the little company<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
had heard the noiseless approach down the
gallery of a black-haired, bare-footed girl. She
had come within a few feet of the group when her
musical tones fell upon their amazed ears.</p>

<p>“<em>Dolores!</em>” exclaimed Patsy and sprang forward
with extended hands. “How came <em>you</em>
here?”</p>

<p>Immediately Mab, Bee and Nellie gathered
around the girl with little astonished cries.</p>

<p>“Soon I will tell all. Now is the hurry.”</p>

<p>Turning to Mr. Carroll, whose fine face mirrored
his astonishment at this sudden new addition
to the night’s eventful happenings, she said
earnestly:</p>

<p>“I stood in the shadow and heard your speech,
<i lang="es">señor</i>. There is but one way into the secret place.
It is there.” She pointed to the picture. “I bid
you watch it well. She is most strong. She has
the madness. Thus her strength is greater than
that of three men. If you have the firearm, <i lang="es">señor</i>,
I entreat you, go for it, and also send these you
love to the safe room. Should she break the rope
of which you have spoken she will come forth
from behind the picture and kill. Now I will
go and return soon with the men. You may trust
me, for I will bring them. Have no fear for me,
for I shall be safe.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p>Without waiting for a response from Mr.
Carroll, Dolores turned and darted up the gallery.
An instant and she had disappeared into
the adjoining corridor.</p>

<p>“Dolores is right,” declared Mr. Carroll.
“Martha, take our girls and Emily into your
room. Lock the door and stay there until I come
for you. I don’t like the idea of this child,
Dolores, going off into the night alone, but she
went before I could stop her.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Dad, why can’t we stay here with you?”
burst disappointedly from Patsy.</p>

<p>Patsy had quite recovered from her momentary
mishap and was now anxious to see the exciting
affair through to the end.</p>

<p>“That’s why.”</p>

<p>Mr. Carroll made a stern gesture toward the
picture. From behind it now issued a fresh succession
of hair-raising screams interspersed with
furious repetitions of the name, “Dolores.” It
was evident that Rosita had heard Dolores’ voice
and, demented though she was, recognized it.</p>

<p>“Come with us this instant, Patsy. You have
already run more than enough risks to-night.”</p>

<p>Miss Martha’s intonation was such as to indicate
that she, too, was yet to be reckoned with.</p>

<p>“We’re in for it,” breathed Bee to Patsy as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
two girls followed Miss Carroll, and the Perry
girls out of the gallery and into the corridor which
led to Miss Martha’s room. Emily, however,
had declared herself as “daid sleepy” and asked
permission to return to her own room instead of
accepting the refuge of Miss Carroll’s.</p>

<p>“I don’t care,” Patsy returned in a defiant
whisper. “Our plan worked. We caught the
ghost. And that’s not all. What about Dolores?
Did you ever bump up against anything so
amazing? Now we know who the mysterious
‘she’ is. No wonder poor Dolores was afraid
of her.”</p>

<p>Now arrived at Miss Carroll’s door, the chums
had no time for further confidences. Miss
Martha hustled them inside the room, hastily
closed the door and turned the key.</p>

<p>That worthy but highly displeased woman’s
next act was to sink into an easy chair and in the
voice of a stern judge order Bee and Patsy to
take chairs opposite her own.</p>

<p>“Now, Patsy, will you kindly tell me why I
was not taken into your confidence regarding
yours and Beatrice’s presumptuous plans? Do
you realize that both of you might have been
killed? What possessed you to do such a thing?
I <em>know</em> that you are far more to blame than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
Beatrice, even though she insisted to me that she
was equally concerned in your scheme. She
merely followed your lead.”</p>

<p>“I’m to blame. I planned the whole thing,”
Patsy frankly confessed. “I don’t know how
much Bee has told you, but this is the story from
beginning to end.”</p>

<p>Without endeavoring to spare herself in the
least, Patsy began with an account of the fearsome
apparition she had seen on the previous
night and went bravely on to the moment when
she had seen old Rosita disappear behind the
picture.</p>

<p>“I shall never trust either of you again,” was
Miss Carroll’s succinct condemnation when
Patsy had finished.</p>

<p>“But, Auntie&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Don’t Auntie me,” retorted Miss Martha.
“The thought of what might have happened to
you both makes me fairly sick. I sha’n’t recover
from the shock for a week. The best thing we
can do is to pack up and go to Palm Beach. I’ve
had enough of this house of horrors. Who knows
what may happen next. Just listen to that!”</p>

<p>Briefly silent, the imprisoned lunatic had
again begun to send forth long, piercing screams.
For a little, painful quiet settled down on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
occupants of Miss Carroll’s room. At last Eleanor
spoke.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe anything else that’s bad will
happen here, Miss Martha.”</p>

<p>Eleanor had come nobly forward to Patsy’s
aid. Standing behind Miss Carroll’s chair, she
laid a gentle hand on the irate matron’s plump
shoulder. Eleanor could usually be depended
upon to pour oil on troubled waters.</p>

<p>“Nothing further of an unpleasant nature will
have <em>time</em> to happen here,” was the significant
response.</p>

<p>“But nothing <em>bad</em> has really happened,” persisted
Eleanor. “Patsy captured the ghost, who
turned out to be old Rosita. Pretty soon she’ll
be taken away where she can’t harm anyone. If
Patsy and Bee hadn’t been awake and on the
watch to-night she might have slipped in and
murdered them and us.”</p>

<p>“Not with our doors locked and the keys in
them,” calmly refuted Miss Carroll. “True,
Patsy and Beatrice might have been murdered.
<em>They</em> disobeyed me and left <em>their</em> door <em>unlocked</em>.”</p>

<p>This emphatic thrust had its effect on the culprits.
They blushed deeply and looked exceedingly
uncomfortable.</p>

<p>“Well, she might have gone slipping about the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
house in the daytime and pounced upon some of
us.” Mabel now rallied to the defense. “Didn’t
Mammy Luce see her cross the kitchen and disappear
up the back stairs right in the middle of
the day? That proves she came here in the daytime
too. By those yells we just heard you can
imagine how much of a chance we would have
had if we’d happened to meet her roaming around
the house.”</p>

<p>Patsy took heart at this brilliant effort on her
behalf.</p>

<p>“That’s why I saw the cavalier picture move
the other day,” she said eagerly. “Rosita had
just disappeared behind it. That’s another proof
she came here in the daytime.”</p>

<p>“Hmph! Here is something else I seem to
have missed hearing,” satirically commented Miss
Carroll.</p>

<p>“I would have told you <em>that</em>, truly I would
have, Auntie, but I didn’t want to worry you. I
thought I must have been mistaken about it at
the time and so didn’t say anything. It was the
day we found the book in the patio and you asked
me what was the matter,” Patsy explained very
humbly.</p>

<p>Something in the two pleading gray eyes fixed
so penitently upon her, moved Miss Martha to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
relent a trifle. She considered herself a great
deal harder-hearted than she really was.</p>

<p>“My dear, you and Beatrice did very wrong to
conceal these things and attempt to take matters
into your own hands. You are two extremely
rash venturesome young girls. You are altogether
too fond of leaping first and looking afterward.
I must say that&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“They’re coming!” Mabel suddenly held up her
hand in a listening gesture.</p>

<p>Even through the closed door the tramp of
heavy footsteps and the deep bass of masculine
voices came distinctly to the ears of the attentive
listeners. Shut in as they were, they could glean
by sound alone an idea of what was transpiring
in the gallery.</p>

<p>Soon, above the growing hum of voices, came a
crashing, splintering sound, accompanied by the
most ear-piercing shrieks they had yet heard. A
babble of shouts arose, above which that high,
piercing wail held its own. Again the tramping
of feet began. The frenzied wailing grew even
higher. The footsteps began to die out; the cries
grew fainter and yet fainter. An almost painful
silence suddenly settled down over the house.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII<br />
<span class="smaller">THE RETURN OF DOLORES</span></h2>

<p>It was shattered by a gentle knock at Miss
Carroll’s door. Light as was the rapping,
it caused the occupants of the room to start
nervously.</p>

<p>“It’s Dad.”</p>

<p>Patsy ran to the door, turned the key and
opened it.</p>

<p>It was not Mr. Carroll, however, who had
rapped. Instead a shy little figure stood in the
corridor. Patsy promptly reached out and
hauled the newcomer into the room with two
affectionate arms.</p>

<p>“Dolores, you brave little thing!” she cried out
admiringly. “You went all the way in the dark
alone for help. Come over here, dear, and sit
down by Auntie. You must be all tired out.”</p>

<p>Patsy led Dolores to a deep chair beside Miss
Martha and pushed her gently into it. The girl<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
leaned wearily back in it. For a moment she sat
thus, eyes closed, her long black lashes sweeping
her tanned cheeks. Then she opened her eyes,
looked straight up at Miss Martha and smiled.</p>

<p>“It is the heaven,” she said solemnly.</p>

<p>“You poor, dear child.”</p>

<p>Miss Martha reached over and took one of the
girl’s small, brown hands in both her own. The
Wayfarers had gathered about Dolores looking
down at her with loving, friendly faces. She was,
to use her own expression, so “<i lang="es">simpatica</i>.” Their
girlish affections went out to her.</p>

<p>“There is much to tell,” she said, straightening
up in her chair, her soft eyes roving from face
to face.</p>

<p>“We’d love to hear it if you aren’t too tired
to tell us,” assured Patsy eagerly. “Where is my
father, Dolores? Did he go with the men who
took Rosita away?”</p>

<p>“Yes. First the <i lang="es">señor</i> showed me the way here.
He gave me the message. He will take Rosita
away in the automobile. So it may be long before
he returns. With him went three black men
and Carlos.”</p>

<p>“Carlos!” went up the astonished cry.</p>

<p>“Yes. You must know it was for Carlos I
went as well as the others. I had said to him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
many times that Rosita was mad. He would not
believe. It was Carlos who brought me to the
house of Rosita when my father had the death.
Rosita had always for me the hate and abused me
much. Carlos cared not. Perhaps he had for me
the hate, too. I believe it.</p>

<p>“I have not come to the beach to have the talk
with you because of Rosita. She watched me too
much of late,” Dolores went on. “She had the
hate for you because you came to Las Golondrinas.
She was afraid I would see you and tell
you she had the hate. She was mad, but yet most
cunning.”</p>

<p>“But why did she hate us, Dolores?” questioned
Bee.</p>

<p>The Wayfarers had now drawn up chairs and
seated themselves in a half circle, facing the little
Spanish girl.</p>

<p>“Soon I will tell you. First I must tell you
that two days ago Carlos went away. Then
Rosita shut me in the cellar. Ah, I knew she had
the wickedness planned! All the day I heard her
above me, speaking, speaking to herself. Sometimes
she laughed and shouted most loud. Then
I could hear her words. She cried out often of
Las Golondrinas and Eulalie and old Manuel.
So I knew what was in her mind.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>“Then perhaps <em>you</em> can tell us who Camillo is
or was!” exclaimed Patsy. “You seem to know
a good deal about the Feredas.”</p>

<p>“How knew you <em>his</em> name?” Dolores turned
startled eyes on Patsy.</p>

<p>Briefly Patsy related the Wayfarers’ one conversation
with Rosita.</p>

<p>“I never knew.” Dolores shook her black head.
“<i lang="es">Comprendo mucho.</i>”</p>

<p>Unconsciously she had dropped into Spanish.</p>

<p>“<em>We</em> don’t understand,” smiled Mabel.</p>

<p>“Ah, but you shall soon know. Now I must
speak again of myself. In the cellar I remained
until this night. But on the night before this,
Rosita went away. She came not back. This
night late came Carlos home. I cried out to him
and so he released me. He was very tired and
would sleep. So he slept and I came here, because
I had the fear that Rosita was hiding in the secret
place to do you the harm. She had known of it
long. Yet she knew not that I knew it, too. It
was Eulalie who showed me, once when I came
here to see her. We were friends. Rosita was
the nurse of Eulalie in her childhood. Eulalie
was <i lang="es">simpatica</i>, but she was most unhappy. Her
grandfather was the cross, terrible old one. He,
too, had the madness. He was <i lang="es">loco</i>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<p>Dolores nodded emphatic conviction of her belief
that Manuel de Fereda had been insane.</p>

<p>“It was the midnight when I came here,” she
resumed. “I lay in the long grass to listen, but
heard nothing. So my thought was that Rosita
might be far away and not in the house. I wished
it to be thus, for I had the shame to knock on the
doors late and say, ‘Beware of Rosita who is
mad.’ I knew that in the daylight I should do
that and tell you all before harm came. So I lay
still and watched the house where all was dark
and quiet. Then I heard the voice of Rosita as
I have heard it never before. I knew not what
had come to her, but I wished to see and give you
the help such as I could give.”</p>

<p>“But how did you get into the house, Dolores?”
questioned Patsy. “All the doors were locked.”</p>

<p>“I climbed the vines, which grow upward to
the small balcony on the western side,” Dolores
said simply. “The window stood open and thus
I came in the time to help.”</p>

<p>“You certainly did, little wood nymph,” declared
Patsy affectionately. “What happened
when you came back with the men? We’re crazy
to know.”</p>

<p>“The <i lang="es">señor</i> asked Carlos of the secret door.
Was it the true door, or but the canvas? Carlos<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
knew not. Of the door he knew from Rosita, but
not the secret. Never had he passed through it.
But I knew that it was the true door with strong
wood behind the canvas. So the picture door
must be shattered by blows. Thus was loosed
the rope which had shut in the door and held
Rosita fast so that she could move but a little. It
was the surprise when I saw her wrapped in the
white sheets. On the floor I saw her long black
cloak. I understood all.”</p>

<p>Dolores’ sweeping gesture indicated her complete
comprehension of a situation which still
baffled her audience not a little.</p>

<p>“How did they get her out of this cubby-hole?”
inquired Miss Carroll interestedly.</p>

<p>Fortunately for Patsy, the arrival of Dolores
had turned her aunt’s attention temporarily from
her reckless niece’s transgressions. Practical
Miss Martha was of the private opinion that she
had been living through a night of adventure far
stranger than fiction. The thought gave her an
undeniable thrill.</p>

<p>“She herself leaped out like the wild beast,”
Dolores answered. “She sprang at Carlos, but
he was ready. The wise <i lang="es">señor</i> had said she would
do this, because the mad turn fiercest against
those they love. The <i lang="es">señor</i> and the black men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
caught her and the <i lang="es">señor</i> wound the rope round
and round her body. Then they carried her down
the stairs and held her fast, while the <i lang="es">señor</i> went
for the automobile. The <i lang="es">señor</i> said she must go
to the police station at Miami. Carlos was sad
for Rosita had loved him much. He had not believed
she was mad.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see how he could <em>help</em> knowing it!”
cried Patsy. “Why, we thought her crazy the
first time we ever saw her! Mabel asked Carlos
about her. It made him angry. I guess he knew
it then, but wouldn’t admit it. I’m sure he must
have told Rosita about us. That must have been
one reason why she forbade you to come near us.
Please tell us, Dolores, why she hated us. You
promised you would.”</p>

<p>“It was because of the treasure of Las Golondrinas.”
Dolores lifted solemn eyes to Patsy.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII<br />
<span class="smaller">THE MEMENTO</span></h2>

<p>“The <em>treasure</em>!” rose in an incredulous
chorus.</p>

<p>“Do you mean that there’s a treasure
hidden somewhere about Las Golondrinas?”
almost shouted Patsy.</p>

<p>“It is truth,” the girl affirmed. “All his life
old Manuel sought but never found. He had the
despair, so he was most cruel to Eulalie, <i lang="es">pobrecita</i>.
How she hated that treasure!”</p>

<p>“Now we know what Rosita meant that day,”
put in Bee. “When she said old Camillo had
hidden it well. Was Camillo a Fereda?”</p>

<p>“<i lang="es">Si; el caballero Camillo de Fereda</i>,” nodded
Dolores, then laughed. “Always I think of
Camillo in Spanish,” she apologized. “I would
say in English: ‘Yes, the gentleman, Camillo de
Fereda.’ He lived long long ago. He was <i lang="es">el
caballero</i> of the painting this night destroyed. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
am glad he is gone. He had the wicked face. He
<em>was</em> wicked; the pirate and the murderer. Eulalie
has told me of him.”</p>

<p>“Then he must have been one of those Spanish
buccaneers who sailed the seas and attacked English
ships about the time when Ponce de Leon
landed here in Florida,” declared Beatrice.</p>

<p>“But that was away back in fifteen something
or other,” objected Eleanor. “Las Golondrinas
hasn’t been the home of the Feredas nearly so
long as that. In those days there was nothing
here but swamps and wilderness. Do you happen
to know just how old this house is, Dolores?”</p>

<p>“Eulalie has said that many, many Feredas
have lived here,” Dolores replied. “All knew of
the treasure but could not find. It was the secret
which passed from the father to the son. Manuel
knew it, but he would never tell Eulalie because
she was not the son. She knew only from him
that there was the treasure for which old Manuel
always searched. She had not the belief in it.”</p>

<p>“Then how did Rosita come to learn of it?”
interrupted Bee quickly.</p>

<p>“I heard her tell Carlos that long ago she spied
upon Manuel. Once, while he wandered in the
woods looking for the treasure, she followed him
all the day. He lay down under the trees to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
sleep. While he slept she crept to him and took
from his pocket the letter and the small paper.
What was written on the small paper she could
not understand, for it was not the Spanish. The
letter was the Spanish. For the many long words
she could not read it well. So she put them again
in Manuel’s pocket. But she swore to Carlos
that old Camillo wrote the letter and that he
wrote of the treasure which he had hidden.”</p>

<p>“Did you tell Eulalie what Rosita said?” pursued
Bee with lawyer-like persistence.</p>

<p>“I dared not. I had the fear she might question
Manuel. Then he would have had the great
anger against Rosita. Then Rosita would have
killed me. When Eulalie was the small child,
Rosita was the nurse and lived in Las Golondrinas.
It was then that she followed Manuel
and read the letter. When Eulalie had the age
of fourteen years, Manuel sent Rosita away to
the cottage to live. Soon after I came here.”</p>

<p>“Rosita couldn’t have liked Eulalie very well.
When we asked her about Eulalie that day she
raved and shrieked ‘<i lang="es">ingrata</i>’ and goodness knows
what else,” related Mabel. “I can understand
enough Spanish to know that she was down on
Eulalie.”</p>

<p>“She had the anger because Eulalie wished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
Las Golondrinas to be sold. While Manuel lived
Rosita dared not look here for the treasure.
When he died she was glad. She wished Eulalie
to let her come here again to live. Eulalie was
weary of this place of sorrow. She cared not
that she was the Fereda. So she sold Las Golondrinas
to the <i lang="es">señor</i>, your father.”</p>

<p>Dolores inclined her head toward Patsy.</p>

<p>“Now I begin to see why Rosita had no use
for us,” smiled Patsy. “She must have had a
fine time hunting the treasure before we came
down here and spoiled sport.”</p>

<p>“It is truth,” concurred Dolores. “All the day
and often in the night she searched everywhere.
She had the keys to this house. She came here
much while it was empty. It was then, I believe,
that the greatest madness fell upon her. She
knew nothing that Eulalie had sold Las Golondrinas
to the <i lang="es">señor</i> until he came here to live. I
remember how angry she was. Still she watched
and went to the house when the <i lang="es">señor</i> was not
there.”</p>

<p>“I have no doubt she was tucked away somewhere
in the grounds watching when we arrived,”
frowned Miss Martha. “We have had a narrow
escape.”</p>

<p>“She saw you,” instantly affirmed Dolores. “It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
was the surprise. She thought the <i lang="es">señor</i> would
live here alone. Then fell the rain and for two
days she went not out of the cottage. I, also,
went not out until the sunshine returned. Then
I ran away into the woods. So you came to the
cottage and I never knew.”</p>

<p>“It’s strange she never said a word to you
about it,” mused Beatrice.</p>

<p>“Ah, no! She spoke to me but little; only the
harsh words. It was to Carlos she would talk,
but not before me. Now I understand why she
was in the great rage when I returned to the
cottage on that morning when you had been there.
You had spoken of these Feredas and Eulalie.
She was afraid you had come here to hunt for the
treasure. She wished to frighten you away.”</p>

<p>“Our theory was not as wild as it might have
been, Patsy,” smiled Bee.</p>

<p>“I suppose Carlos was hunting for the treasure,
too, and so helped along this lunatic’s plans to
play ghost. She could never have thought out
the idea herself. I shall have Carlos arrested and
locked up as a dangerous character,” announced
Miss Carroll with stern determination.</p>

<p>“Carlos has no belief in the treasure.” Dolores
paused uncertainly. “I will tell you the truth.
Carlos will not return. He will slip away from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
the <i lang="es">señor</i> at Miami. So he called out to me in
Spanish when he went away with Rosita. He
had no plans with Rosita to play the ghost. She
only had that thought.”</p>

<p>“Then why did he allow her to do so?” asked
Miss Carroll severely. “He knew it. He warned
our cook to beware of a ghost that walked here.”</p>

<p>“Carlos hates the <i lang="es">Americanos</i>. Once he was
to marry the Mexican <i lang="es">señorita</i>. She left him and
married the <i lang="es">Americano</i>. Now he hates them all.
Thus he was glad to have Rosita make the trouble.
He believed it was for the sake of him more
than the treasure. She told him this. She was
mad, but cunning. She deceived him. He is
most stupid and easy to deceive. He did not believe
she would harm anyone. He thought she
had the malice; not the madness. Now he knows,
because she sprang at him.”</p>

<p>“Well, I must say it’s the most preposterous
affair all around that I’ve ever heard of,”
sharply opined Miss Carroll. “To come to Florida
for a vacation and be picked out as victims
by a vengeful Mexican and a lunatic! It’s simply
appalling.”</p>

<p>“Oh, look!”</p>

<p>Patsy had risen and was pointing toward a
window.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>

<p>“What is it?” burst simultaneously from Bee,
Mabel and Eleanor. Miss Martha was sitting
bolt upright in her chair as though preparing to
face the worst.</p>

<p>Dolores, alone, did not stir. She lay back in
her chair, eyes closed. Her strenuous watch on
the house, her brave run for help through the
darkness and the fact that she had never before
in her life talked so much at one time, had combined
to reduce her to a state of utter exhaustion.
All in a minute she had dropped fast asleep. She
had not even heard Patsy cry out.</p>

<p>“Why&mdash;did you ever! See! It’s <em>daylight</em>!”</p>

<p>Patsy’s voice had risen to a little wondering
squeal on the last word.</p>

<p>Daylight it surely was. Through the windows
the soft rays of dawn were stealing, heralding the
fact that day was breaking upon a company of
persons who had been too much occupied to
notice the flight of time.</p>

<p>“Look at that child!” Miss Martha dramatically
indicated the slumbering wood nymph. “I
should have put her to bed the instant she stepped
into this room, instead of allowing her to tell
that long story. I am ashamed of my lack of
judgment.”</p>

<p>“She wanted to tell it, and we wanted to hear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
it,” Patsy said. “It’s been a weird night, hasn’t
it?”</p>

<p>“Weird, yes; altogether too weird. Go to bed
every one of you, and <em>lock your doors</em>!”</p>

<p>“Where will Dolores sleep, Auntie? She
can’t go home. She hasn’t any home now. She’ll
have to stay with us. Won’t that be fine?” exulted
Patsy.</p>

<p>“Dolores will remain here with me. We’ll discuss
her future later. This is certainly not the
time to discuss it. Good night, or, rather, good
morning. Off to bed, all of you.”</p>

<p>Miss Martha fairly shooed her flock out of the
room. They departed with laughter, their cheerful
voices echoing through a corridor lately filled
with sounds of an entirely different nature.</p>

<p>“Enter without fear, my dear Miss Forbes,”
salaamed Patsy, bowing Bee into the room in
which had been staged the first act of the night’s
drama. “The ghost is forever laid.”</p>

<p>Laughing, Bee stepped over the threshold.
The laugh suddenly trailed into a gasp. At the
precise spot where Patsy had lassoed Rosita lay
a sinister memento of the mad “ghost.” It was a
long, sharp, two-edged knife.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV<br />
<span class="smaller">THE SECRET DRAWER</span></h2>

<p>Instead of a one o’clock luncheon that
day the Wayfarers sat down to a one o’clock
breakfast. It was noon before they awoke
from the sound sleep they were so much in need
of after their all-night vigil.</p>

<p>That day there was a new face at the breakfast
table. It was a vividly beautiful face lighted by
a pair of soulful, dark eyes. Dolores, the wood
nymph, had been transformed over night into
Dolores, the young woman. Dressed in one of
Patsy’s white morning frocks, her heavy black
hair rolled into a graceful knot at the nape of
her neck, Dolores bore small resemblance to the
ragged, bare-footed waif of the night before.</p>

<p>Now those small bare feet which had sped so
swiftly through the darkness for help were for
the first time in years covered by slippers and
stockings. Though Dolores was too shy to say<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
it this one particular feature of the transformation
seemed to her the most wonderful of all.
“To go always with the feet bare” had been her
greatest cross.</p>

<p>Seated between Bee and Patsy at table her
gaze wandered questioningly from one to another
of the Wayfarers, as though unable to
credit the evidence of her own eyes. She could
hardly believe that she was in the midst of reality.
It all seemed like a dear dream from which she
would soon awaken, only to find again the old
life of poverty, harsh words and blows.</p>

<p>Naturally, the Wayfarers had a good deal to
say. They were still brimming over with the excitement
of the night’s events, the final touch of
melodrama having been furnished by the finding
of the knife on the floor of Patsy’s and Bee’s
room.</p>

<p>Recovered from the momentary shock sight of
the murderous weapon had given them, the finders
had agreed that there was no use in exhibiting
it to the others just then and stirring up fresh
excitement.</p>

<p>Patsy reserved it as a breakfast surprise. She
created not a little commotion when she produced
it at the table for her companions’ inspection,
coolly announcing that Rosita had left her a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
keepsake. The weapon went the round of the
table to the tune of much horrified exclamation,
as its formidable, razor-like double edge was
shudderingly noted.</p>

<p>“I can’t imagine why your father hasn’t returned,
Patsy,” remarked Miss Carroll for the
fifth time since they had sat down to breakfast.
“I am beginning to feel very uneasy over his
continued absence.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe we’ll see him until evening,”
returned Patsy. “It must have been daylight
before he got through with Rosita’s case. He had
two business engagements in Miami to-day.
Don’t you remember? He mentioned them to us
at dinner last night?”</p>

<p>“I had forgotten that,” admitted Miss Carroll.
“It’s hardly to be wondered at. I wish he would
come home. I am all at sea about what we ought
to do. Now that this horrible lunatic has been
removed from here and her villainous grandson
has decamped, it is just possible we may have a
little peace and quiet. Do you think this rascal
Carlos meant what he said to you, Dolores?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Señora Martha. He will never return,”
Dolores assured. “He will sell the cottage which
old Manuel gave to Rosita and never come here
more. I am glad. Now I shall go myself soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
to Miami and find the work to do. I am strong
and not afraid of the work.”</p>

<p>“My dear child, you will do nothing of the
sort,” contradicted Miss Carroll. “You will stay
with us for the present.”</p>

<p>“And when we go north, Dolores, you’re going
too,” broke in Patsy. “You haven’t any folks
now, except us, so you’ve just got to be good
and hang around with the crowd.”</p>

<p>“It is too much,” Dolores protested. “I will
stay for a little because you wish it. I wish it,
also,” she added with shy honesty. “Soon I must
go away. I am not the burden.”</p>

<p>“Of course you aren’t. You don’t look a bit
like a burden,” gaily retorted Patsy. “Let’s not
talk about your going away. Let’s talk about
the treasure of Las Golondrinas. Do you suppose
there really <em>is</em> a treasure?”</p>

<p>“<i lang="es">Quien sabe?</i>” shrugged Dolores.</p>

<p>“That means literally, ‘Who knows?’” translated
Mabel, smiling at Dolores. “But <em>you</em> really
mean, ‘I doubt it.’”</p>

<p>“I have little belief,” confessed Dolores.
“Many Feredas have searched but never found.
Perhaps, then, there is none to find.”</p>

<p>“I wish we knew something of its history,”
sighed Bee. “What do you suppose old Manuel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
did with the letter and the paper that Rosita took
from him while he was asleep?”</p>

<p>“Very likely he put them in the secret drawer,”
chuckled Eleanor, casting a teasing glance at
Mabel.</p>

<p>“Well, he might have,” stoutly defended
Mabel. “I guess I’ll have another try at the old
desk this afternoon. If there’s a treasure in this
house we must do our best to find it.”</p>

<p>“You girls had best stay quietly indoors to-day.”
admonished Miss Carroll. “None of you
are half rested from last night.”</p>

<p>“Señora Martha, I have the wish to go to the
cottage,” requested Dolores timidly. “I have
there the few things which were my father’s. I
desire them. When I have them I will go to that
cottage no more.”</p>

<p>“My dear, you must feel that you are free to
go and come as you choose,” returned Miss Carroll,
“except that I would prefer, while you are
here with us, that you let me know beforehand
where you intend to go. I wish you to feel that
I have the same interest in you that I have in
Patsy’s friends, Bee, Mabel and Eleanor. If you
were to go away without telling anyone where
you were going we would be uneasy until you
returned.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>

<p>“I <em>desire</em> to give the obedience to you, Señora
Martha! It will be most beautiful,” Dolores
made fervent response.</p>

<p>“I wish others felt the same about it,” commented
Miss Carroll pointedly, yet with a smile,
as she rose from the table.</p>

<p>Patsy merely laughed, though she colored
slightly at the roundabout rebuke.</p>

<p>“It’s too late for regrets, Auntie,” she declared.
“I promise to do better in future. May Bee and
I go to the cottage with Dolores?”</p>

<p>Miss Martha, having demurred a little, finally
gave a reluctant consent. Patsy and Bee ran upstairs
for their hats. Having gone hatless for
years, Dolores had declined Patsy’s offer of one
of her own.</p>

<p>Presently the three girls left the house and
took the path to the orange groves through which
they must pass in order to reach old Rosita’s cottage.</p>

<p>Coming at last to the cottage, they saw that the
door stood wide open. The two Wayfarers experienced
a sense of dread as they followed Dolores
across the stone threshold into a big, cheerless
room which occupied the greater part of the
ground floor. Both had an uncomfortable feeling
that Rosita might suddenly appear and pounce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
upon them. They were surprised to find extreme
neatness where they had expected to view
disorder. The floor was immaculately clean and
the few pieces of old-fashioned furniture stood
stiffly in place.</p>

<p>“I had an idea we’d find everything upside
down,” Patsy remarked. “Rosita was a good
housekeeper even if she was crazy.”</p>

<p>“Ah, but it was I who must do the work,”
sighed Dolores. “All must be clean save the windows.
These Rosita purposely kept dark with
the cobwebs so that strangers might not see into
the room. Of herself she did nothing, yet she
made me to do all. She was indeed mad for long.
Always she feared strangers, but none ever came.
It is past. I am glad. Wait here for me. I
must go up the stairs to the place where I slept.
There I have the few things I wish to take
away.”</p>

<p>With this Dolores disappeared up a short staircase
which opened into the rear wall of the
room and led to a loft. As there was nothing in
the ugly bare-walled room to attract their interest,
Bee and Patsy presently sat down on a
wooden bench outside the house to await Dolores’
return.</p>

<p>She soon appeared, carrying an antiquated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
canvas telescope which she proudly assured them
had belonged to her father.</p>

<p>“When we return to Las Golondrinas I will
show you the picture of my father,” she promised.
“He was the good man and loved me much.
Now we shall leave this place. I have the hope
never to enter it again.”</p>

<p>Dolores raised her hand in a solemn gesture
toward the sky.</p>

<p>“The God in the Heaven heard me pray,” she
said, then reverently crossed herself. “He has
given me the freedom.”</p>

<p>The trio were rather silent on the walk back to
Las Golondrinas. Dolores’ thoughts were upon
the great change that had come to her. Patsy
and Bee had been deeply impressed by her little
act of reverence and divine faith toward the Almighty.
In consequence, they, too, were absorbed
in thought.</p>

<p>Accompanying Dolores to the room which
Miss Martha had that day given the little girl
for her own, they watched her unpack the satchel
and showed kindly interest in the few keepsakes
she possessed, which had belonged to her father.
Viewing the faded photograph of the latter, they
could trace in Dolores’ beautiful face a distinct
likeness to the handsome photographed features.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>

<p>“Old Rosita could teach us a lesson in neatness,”
Patsy said to Bee as they entered their
own room. “Emily was so busy, I told her we’d
fix up our room to-day. We might as well move
the table back to the center of the room. The
ghost won’t walk ever again.”</p>

<p>“Come on, then. I’ll help you.”</p>

<p>Tossing her hat on the bed, Bee crossed the
room and took hold with both hands of one end
of the heavy mahogany center table. As she
stood waiting for Patsy to come to her, her hands
played absently along the table’s edge.</p>

<p>“Coming in a minute,” called Patsy, who had
stopped to retie her white buckskin Oxford.</p>

<p>“Oh!”</p>

<p>Bee gave a sharp little scream. She had felt
the wood move under her straying fingers.
Something suddenly shot out from the table end.
Sheer surprise caused her to take a stumbling
backward step.</p>

<p>“Patsy, look here!” she cried out shrilly.</p>

<p>Instantly Patsy left off tying her shoelace and
obeyed the call in a hurry. What she saw was
sufficiently amazing to warrant her haste.</p>

<p>While Mabel had spent long hours of patient
search for a secret drawer in the old desk, Bee
had come upon one unawares.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXV">CHAPTER XXV<br />
<span class="smaller">WHAT THE SECRET DRAWER HELD</span></h2>

<p>The secret drawer, which Bee’s straying
fingers had unwittingly released from
its hiding place, projected about six
inches from the table end. It measured perhaps
eight inches across and two in depth. When
closed its front formed one of the carved oblong
designs which repeated itself at intervals of two
inches apart on the overhanging mahogany strips
constituting the two ends of the table. The oblong
which masked the secret drawer was the last
to the left on the end on which Bee had taken
hold when about to move the table back to its
original place.</p>

<p>These facts relative to the secret drawer were,
for the time being, lost on the two girls. Heads
together, they were wonderingly examining a
square, thin little book, bound in stained sheepskin,
which Bee had snatched from the drawer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span></p>

<p>“‘The Private and Personal Diary of one Sir
John Holden, Passenger on His Majesty’s Ship
<i>Dragon</i>,’” Bee was reading aloud from the
book’s first page. The words were inscribed in
faded ink in a fine running hand.</p>

<p>“Why, this is a <em>real</em> diary!” she exclaimed. “It
was kept by an <em>Englishman</em>! It must be awfully
old!”</p>

<p>“Turn over to the next page,” eagerly commanded
Patsy, “and let’s see what it’s all about.”</p>

<p>Holding the book in both hands, Bee let go of
it with her right and started to turn the first leaf.
As she did so a folded paper slid from the back of
the book to the floor.</p>

<p>Patsy made a quick dive for it and picked it
up with: “It’s a letter, I guess. Shall we look
at it first or go on with the diary?”</p>

<p>“Let’s not look at either, just yet. Let’s call
the folks in here and read the diary and the letter
when we’re all together,” proposed Bee generously.
“It will be more fun. They’ll be awfully
surprised to see the secret drawer; Mab especially.”</p>

<p>“All right,” amiably agreed Patsy. “You go
for Mab, Eleanor and Dolores. I’ll see if
Auntie has had her nap and is awake. If she’s
sleeping I won’t disturb her. We may find nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
very interesting, after all, in this old diary.
Anyhow we can show it to her afterward.”</p>

<p>Carefully laying letter and diary on the table
from which both had emanated, the two Wayfarers
sped from the room on their respective
errands.</p>

<p>Patsy returned first and without her aunt.
Finding Miss Martha sleeping peacefully, she
had foreborne to disturb her.</p>

<p>When Beatrice presently appeared in company
with the three others, they found Patsy
busily examining the secret drawer which still
stood open.</p>

<p>“You were on the wrong trail, Mab,” she
laughingly greeted. “Bee beat you to it after
all.”</p>

<p>“So I hear. Lets see your wonderful find.”</p>

<p>The newcomers crowded about the drawer, exclaiming
over it, girl fashion. They were also
duly impressed by the sheepskin book and the letter
which, Patsy informed them, had been tucked
away in the drawer. Mabel, however, was more
interested in the drawer itself.</p>

<p>“It takes up exactly the same amount of space
as one of those oblongs,” she cried out, as her
observing eyes traveled the length of the table
end. Having spent so much time on the antiquated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
desk she was naturally much interested
in the mechanics of the secret drawer Bee had
discovered.</p>

<p>“Never mind the drawer now, Mab. You can
play with it later. We’ll leave it open. If we
were to shut it, very likely we couldn’t open it
again.”</p>

<p>This from Patsy, who was impatiently longing
to start a reading of the old diary.</p>

<p>“Be seated, ladies,” she merrily ordered. “Miss
Patricia Carroll has kindly consented to read you
a few interesting excerpts from the diary of one
Sir John Holden. Goodness knows who he was.
We’ll know more about him after we’ve read
what he’s written about himself.”</p>

<p>“I thought you told us you two hadn’t read the
diary,” playfully accused Eleanor. “You seem
to know all about it.”</p>

<p>“We read only the first page,” Bee explained.
“We didn’t go on with it because we wanted you
girls to be in on it, too. There’s nothing stingy
about us.”</p>

<p>“So I observe. We are nothing if not appreciative.”</p>

<p>“This was the room of old Manuel,” irrelevantly
remarked Dolores. She had been silently
listening to the girls’ lively chatter, her great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
dark eyes roving curiously about the spacious
room.</p>

<p>“It <em>was</em>!” Bee exclaimed. “That’s interesting
to know. It explains why Rosita paid us those
two midnight visits. She may have thought
Manuel de Fereda had found the treasure and
tucked it away in his room. Are you sure this
was <em>his</em> room, Dolores?”</p>

<p>“<i lang="es">Si.</i>” Dolores wagged an emphatic head.
“Once Eulalie showed it to me. We came only
to the door. Still I remember. It was truly his
room.”</p>

<p>“Then Manuel must have put this book in the
drawer,” declared Patsy. “Well, let’s find out
what an English passenger on ‘His Majesty’s
Ship <i>Dragon</i>’ had to do with the Feredas.”</p>

<p>Her companions having drawn up chairs and
seated themselves in a half circle, Patsy picked
up the little sheepskin book and eagerly turned
to the second page.</p>

<p>“‘August the fifth,’” she began, then gave a
little amazed gasp. “Girls,” she said in awed
tones, “this date is ‘<em>sixteen</em> hundred and eighteen!’”</p>

<p>A murmur of surprise ascended at this announcement.</p>

<p>“Go on, Patsy,” urged Bee. “What happened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
on August the fifth, sixteen hundred and
eighteen?”</p>

<p>“‘One hour after sunrise,’” Patsy resumed,
“‘we weighed anchor and blessed by a fair wind
we set sail from the port of Southampton, bound
for Virginia, His Most Gracious Majesty’s
colony in the New World, which, by the aid and
mercy of God, we hope to reach in safety and
before many weeks have elapsed. It is now evening
and the good wind still continues to fill the
<i>Dragon’s</i> sails. I shall retire at once as the
events of the day have been somewhat fatiguing.’”</p>

<p>“That’s all for August the fifth,” she said.
“The next is August the tenth, so it’s really a
journal instead of a diary.”</p>

<p>“This John Holden probably intended to keep
a diary and then didn’t,” surmised Bee.</p>

<p>“How funny!” ejaculated Patsy. “That’s
almost exactly what he’s written. Listen:</p>

<p>“‘My original intention consisted in the resolve
to chronicle faithfully the events of each
day. I am deeply regretful that divers matters
have completely engaged my attention which
have thus caused it to be impossible for me to
perform this duty which I laid upon myself.
Thus far the Almighty hath indeed favored us.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
We were for a day becalmed, but since that time
we have encountered exceptionally favoring
winds, which have steadily furthered us on our
course. If Providence wills a continuation of this
remarkably fine weather we shall accomplish the
voyage sooner, perhaps, than we had the temerity
to hope.’”</p>

<p>“He certainly used a lot of words to express
himself,” smiled Eleanor.</p>

<p>“Long words and lots of them were the fashion
in those days,” commented Bee. “Go on,
Patsy.”</p>

<p>“‘August the twelfth. The fine weather still
prevails. We are inspired to believe that God is
with us. Among the hundred and ten males on
board our good ship, not one now suffereth the
slightest indisposition. During the first three
days of the voyage a small number were afflicted
with the malady of seasickness, which is grievously
unpleasant in that it is attended by extreme
nauseation of the stomach. Fortunately this annoying
complaint is always of short duration.
All those thus distressed have recovered and appear
to be in better health than ever. I trust
that this felicitous state of affairs may continue.</p>

<p>“‘August the twentieth: This day a sad accident
occurred. By some dire mischance one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
our crew, a faithful fellow but one whose clumsiness
I have frequently noted, fell overboard.
Immediately our captain bestirred himself to accomplish
his rescue, but in vain. Being a poor
swimmer, the unfortunate fellow was unable to
sustain himself above the waves until succor
came, and thus perished in the sea before our very
eyes. I trust that this distressing event is not a
forerunner of greater disaster. The crew, who
are inclined somewhat toward silly superstition,
appear to regard it as an ill omen.</p>

<p>“‘August the twenty-ninth: Our favoring
winds have ceased to blow. This day we have
made no progress worth recording. As I gazed
out over the vast expanse of ocean this evening,
during the setting of the sun, I was reminded of
the words of the beloved Apostle John: “And
I saw a sea of glass mingled with fire.” We
should give thanks devoutly, inasmuch as while
we are thus irritatingly becalmed, such a condition
is to be preferred to foul weather and heavy
seas.</p>

<p>“‘September the fourth: After five days of
such feeble progress as maketh the heart sick, we
are speeding forward once more under billowing
sails. On board ship all are in excellent spirits
at this welcome dispensation of divine Providence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
We now entertain high hopes of reaching
our destination ere the coming of the dreaded
equinoctial gales which are well able to send the
stoutest ship to the bottom of the sea.</p>

<p>“‘I fear these tempests far more than the possibility
that we may be attacked by the Spanish.
We are, I believe, well prepared to meet the
Spanish villains and worst them, should they appear
against us. We have on board the <i>Dragon</i>
no mean defense in the way of cannon, powder,
some hundred rounds of great artillery and divers
small armament. All this, of course, being vitally
necessary, inasmuch as among us we are possessed
of enough in the way of gold, silver and precious
stones to excite the greed of these inhuman cut-throats
should they get wind of our coming.’”</p>

<p>“This is getting wildly interesting!” exclaimed
Bee. “At last we have with us a <em>treasure</em>. I believe
it must be the treasure of Las Golondrinas,
else why would old Manuel have kept this diary
hidden away?”</p>

<p>“But this ship, the <i>Dragon</i>, was bound for Virginia,
not Florida,” reminded Mabel. “I don’t
see much connection between this John Holden’s
diary and Las Golondrinas. Besides, there
couldn’t have been such a place as Las Golondrinas
at the time he made this voyage.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span></p>

<p>“Stop interrupting me and maybe we’ll find
out something more about things,” laughingly
rebuked Patsy. “The next entry is as follows:</p>

<p>“‘September the fifteenth: Until yesterday
all progressed with such remarkable serenity that
I had nothing of import to inscribe upon the
pages of this book. Last evening at sunset we
encountered a small Spanish galleon which villainously
opened fire upon us, killing two of our
crew and slightly wounding four others. Our
master gunner immediately retaliated with a
fierceness of fire which presently caused our
enemy to abandon the attack and sail away with
all speed. When the retreating galleon had become
but a distant speck on the wide sea we gathered
on deck and offered our profound thanks to
God for his mercy in thus preserving us from our
enemies. May He continue thus to bestow his
favor upon us.</p>

<p>“‘September the sixteenth: This day we committed
to the depths of the ocean the bodies of the
two poor fellows, slain by the dastardly Spanish.
We buried them with such honors and reverence
as befitted the brave death which they had suffered.
I have hopes that those who received
wounds will quickly recover. Our hearts are
exceedingly heavy over the loss of two excellent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
men, both having ever been sober, industrious,
God-fearing fellows.</p>

<p>“‘September the twentieth: According to the
reckonings, which, for my own satisfaction, I
have computed privately with the utmost carefulness,
we are still many hundred miles from
land. Since morning the wind hath risen to a considerable
strength and velocity. The sky to-night
presents a lowering aspect, thus causing us to entertain
dark misgivings. The sea is becoming
tumultuous and the height of the waves is greater
than at any time since we embarked upon this
voyage. I fear that we shall yet taste the fury
of the equinoctial gales. I believe to-day’s change
but heralds the commencement of this trial. We
must be of stout heart and ready arm, placing
our trust in the Almighty who hath thus far so
abundantly safeguarded us.</p>

<p>“‘September the thirtieth: We have fallen
upon evil days. I sadly mistrust that it will be
long ere our eyes behold the goodly colony of
Virginia. On the night of September the twenty-first
the storm, which I had rightly predicted,
burst fiercely upon us. Against the fury of the
blast and the seas which rose mountain-high to
engulf us, the <i>Dragon</i> prevailed only by a miracle
wrought by Providence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span></p>

<p>“‘For three days we labored in the teeth of the
tempest, which ripped bare certain of our masts
and flung us far off our course. Since then the
wind hath continued to blow with exceeding
roughness, and the waves yet remain of unpleasant
height. Day upon day hath seen our ship
tossed about like a cork on the waters.</p>

<p>“‘My private computations lead me to entertain
the dismaying apprehension that we must be
very far south of Virginia. Ere long I fear we
shall see the coast of that debatable land, Florida,
which harboreth the inhuman Spaniard. Should
this misfortune encompass us we shall find ourselves
hard put to escape falling into their
clutches, for their pirate ships continually scour
the southern waters in quest of rich booty.</p>

<p>“‘October the fourth: This morning we sighted
land and were concerned altogether as to what
should be our course of action. A fairly stiff
breeze drove us steadily toward shore until we
could plainly distinguish white sands and a profuseness
of tropical vegetation that accordeth
well with the faithful description of Florida made
public by that gallant knight, Sir Walter
Raleigh, whom His Majesty hath so illy recompensed
for his great services. The warmth of the
atmosphere also tended to confirm our judgment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span></p>

<p>“‘Whereas our good ship had suffered hard
buffeting by wind and sea, we took counsel together
and were of one mind that we should proceed
toward shore and drop anchor until we could
encompass such labor as was needful to render
the ship seaworthy once more. For we were desirous
of turning the <i>Dragon</i> about in order to
pursue a course due north which would, after
many days, bring us to Virginia. And we
weighed carefully the peril in which we stood that
we might at any hour be attacked by hostile galleons
and mayhap find ourselves overwhelmed
and delivered into the cruel and merciless hands
of the Spaniard. Yet we knew that we had no
choice save to incur this hazard. Now it draweth
toward sunset. This day we have labored diligently
and accomplished much. Neither have
we been molested.’”</p>

<p>“The next entry is so dim I can hardly make it
out,” Patsy announced. “It looks as though it
might have been written in pencil. I didn’t know
there were any lead pencils as early as 1618.”</p>

<p>“There were, though,” Bee affirmed. “I remember
reading in a magazine awhile ago that
the first lead pencils were made in fifteen hundred
and something. I can’t recall the exact
date.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, I’m sure this was written in pencil,”
returned Patsy. “Don’t be impatient if I stumble
a little in reading the entry for it’s awfully
dim.”</p>

<p>“Do go on,” implored Eleanor. “We’re keyed
up to a high pitch of suspense to hear what happened
next.”</p>

<p>“‘October the fifth,’” Patsy obediently resumed.
“‘This morning at sunrise we were attacked
by a Spanish galleon which inflicted sore
injuries to our good ship. Yet we rendered such
sturdy account of ourselves as to force our enemy
to draw off and speed away, I doubted not in
order to bring other galleons against us. All that
which we accomplished yesterday hath been undone
by the divers volleys of shots which the
enemy hurled against us.</p>

<p>“‘The galleon having been put to flight we
again took counsel. Rather than permit the
passing of such valuables as each of us possessed
into the greedy fingers of the Spaniard, we made
haste to place all together in a strong chest. Each
man attended to the gathering of his gold, silver
and jewels into a small bag, his name being written
upon paper and placed within the bag on
top of his wealth. These bags we placed in the
seaman’s chest together with a fine gold service<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
which His Majesty had entrusted to our captain,
to be delivered to a certain knight in Virginia.</p>

<p>“‘When all was done the weight of the box was
so great six men could scarcely bear it to the
ship’s boat. To me was intrusted the command
of these men, who were ordered to row to shore
and there bury the box in the earth against the
time when we might be able to return for it. This
we did and found for the treasure a secure hiding
place and buried it at the true sign of the <i>Dragon</i>,
which was also His Majesty’s ship, sunk this day,
so that we could not mistake it on our return.
Our interest was then to proceed speedily to the
ship, for we had agreed to weigh anchor and sail
away, crippled though we were.</p>

<p>“‘Yet while we floundered our way back to the
shore, through well-nigh impassable green
growths, infested with loathsome serpents which
we slaughtered in numbers, we heard shots and
knew that disaster had come upon our ship. So
we made haste to gain the shore, but bethought
ourselves to hide at the edge of the jungle rather
than show ourselves before we had learned the
cause of the firing. And we saw a mighty Spanish
galleon bearing down on the <i>Dragon</i> and
knowing that we could do nothing were compelled
to lie where we were and watch the unequal fight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
between our gallant ship and the great, high-built
galleon.</p>

<p>“‘But the <i>Dragon</i> fought on until her masts
were beaten overboard and all her tackle cut
asunder and her upper work altogether razed,
until, in effect, she evened with the water, nothing
of her being left overhead either for flight
or defense.</p>

<p>“‘Then our captain, who well knew what torture
awaited those on board the <i>Dragon</i> when
the Spaniard should set foot upon her, must
surely have ordered the master gunner to split
and sink the ship. This I believe, because suddenly
on board the <i>Dragon</i> a terrific explosion
took place and she broke in two and sank with
all her crew and passengers.</p>

<p>“‘Then those of us who survived because of
our errand on shore took counsel among ourselves
and there seemed naught to be done save to
go deeper into the jungle and hide ourselves until
such time as we might be safe to come forth and
trust ourselves to the mercy of the sea in our
frail boat. For we had bethought ourselves when
we landed to carry our boat across the sands and
conceal it in the bushes. We were convinced that
of the two the sea was possessed of more mercy
than the Spaniard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span></p>

<p>“‘So we lay for a little and watched the galleon
which went not away but hovered near where
our ill-fated ship had disappeared beneath the
waters. Presently we saw that which gave us
sore alarm. We observed the putting down of a
boat from the galleon’s side, and we counted ten
men, all stoutly armed, who quickly betook themselves
over the side and manned this boat as
soon as it rode the waters. Then we were of the
belief that this galleon had been lurking in the
waters behind a small but thickly wooded tongue
of land to the north of us, this tongue of land
forming one end of a curve in the sands which in
shape bore the likeness to a new moon.</p>

<p>“‘We doubted not that the first galleon which
we had worsted was in complicity with this second.
We were convinced that both these had
stolen upon us in the night. Whereas the first
had been driven off by us, but with dear loss to
ourselves. Those on board the second galleon
must surely have observed our plight and thus
bided their hour to attack us and complete our
destruction. And while they thus waited it is
certain they must in some manner have become
aware of the lowering of the strong box into our
boat and this same boat putting off to shore.</p>

<p>“‘And we knew that we were undone and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
must seek such refuge as we might find in the
jungle. Thereupon we set off in great haste, this
time paying no heed to the disgusting serpents
which frequently wriggled under our feet and
hissed their displeasure of us, though by miracle
we were stung by none of them.</p>

<p>“‘Thus we continued to struggle deeper into
the jungle with as much speed as we could, and
we marveled that we had not yet heard our pursuers
behind us. For we were determined to push
ever forward until we discovered a fitting place
of concealment in the hope that there we might
escape being hunted out by them. We were resolved,
should they discover us, to fight to the
death, for we were well armed.</p>

<p>“‘And after much painful wandering we came
into a ravine and found a natural cavern the
mouth of which was so overhung with broad-leaved
green vines and obscured by bushes as to
deceive us at first that aught of a cave was there.
And we were overjoyed at this unexpected gain,
for we reckoned that even as it had deceived us so
it might deceive the Spaniard. Whereupon we
severed with exceeding care enough of the vines
as would permit us room to pass into the cavern
and crept therein, one after another. And by
good fortune one of the men had with him a bit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
of wax candle which we lighted by means of a
flint and steel. And we were relieved to find the
cave dry and free from scorpions and serpents.</p>

<p>“It is now well past midday and still we are
undiscovered. Having naught else to do I have
taken my book, which never leaveth my person,
and inscribed these facts therein by such dim light
as filtereth through a little between our sheltering
curtain of vines. If, by the grace of God, I
survive this trial I shall ever regard this record
as of higher interest than those which I have on
divers occasions previous to this derived pleasure
in inscribing herein. Should we escape the Spaniard
we shall be still in an evil case to procure
food, and defend ourselves against wild beasts
and savages. These last we have not yet seen,
yet I doubt not their presence in this untamed
wilderness which now encompasseth us. We are
resolved to be of steady courage and good cheer.
Our faith reposeth in the Almighty who holdeth
us in the hollow of His hand and who will deal
with us as He deemeth best. We hold&mdash;&mdash;’”</p>

<p>Patsy suddenly stopped reading.</p>

<p>“That’s all!” she exclaimed disappointedly.
“It breaks off at ‘We hold’ with a long scrawl of
the ‘d’ as though Sir John Holden had been suddenly
interrupted.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span></p>

<p>“It’s wonderful!” Bee drew a long breath.
“While Patsy was reading that last entry I imagined
I could see those poor men fleeing for their
lives through the jungle. The queer part of it
is that it must be <em>true</em>. It’s almost as though this
Sir John Holden, who lived three hundred years
ago, had suddenly come back and spoken to us.”</p>

<p>“Do you suppose the Spaniards found their
hiding place and killed them?” asked Eleanor.
“Do let me look at the ending of that last entry,
Patsy.”</p>

<p>Patsy handed the open book to Eleanor.
Peering over her shoulder, Bee, Dolores and
Mabel scrutinized it with her. For a time a lively
discussion went on among the five girls concerning
the book and the amazing narrative it contained.
Its abrupt ending pointed to disaster to
the fugitive Englishmen.</p>

<p>“I believe the strong box these men buried was
the treasure that old Manuel Fereda spent his
life hunting for,” finally asserted Bee. “According
to description, the place where they went
ashore corresponds to the new moon curve of our
bathing beach. Don’t you remember how the
north end of the curve runs out to a point? The
beach goes deep in above there in another shorter
curve that makes a natural harbor. I noticed it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
the other day when we had the race. We swam
just a little way past that point.”</p>

<p>“I remember it now,” Patsy looked up, an
almost startled expression in her eyes. “It
doesn’t seem possible that all this I’ve been reading
about ever happened on the very shore we’ve
been using for a bathing beach. If it did happen
there, then they buried the treasure somewhere
in the woods back of it. How did Manuel come
by this journal? That’s what I’d like to know.”</p>

<p>“This journal has been handed down from one
generation of Feredas to another,” returned Bee
promptly. “What about Camillo de Fereda, the
portrait cavalier? Judging from his costume in
the picture he must have lived at about the same
time as this journal was written. Eulalie told
Dolores that he was a pirate and a murderer.
He might have been on the very galleon that
fought the <i>Dragon</i>. He might have been among
the Spaniards who went ashore after Sir John
and his men. Maybe the Spaniards found them
and killed them all and brought back this book
to the galleon. I’ve been trying to figure it out
and that’s the way I think it was.”</p>

<p>“It sounds very plausible,” agreed Patsy,
much impressed. “Isn’t it maddening to find out
this much only to realize that we’ll never know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
the rest? If there’s a treasure no wonder the
Feredas could never find it. All Sir John says
about it is that they buried it at the true sign
of the <i>Dragon</i>. Now what did he mean by that?”</p>

<p>“Well never know, nor will anyone else. If
there’s really a treasure buried in the woods behind
the beach it will probably stay there forever,”
predicted Mabel.</p>

<p>“I guess it will,” agreed Patsy. “I know we’ll
never hunt for it. I can imagine Auntie’s face
if I proposed digging up those woods to find it.
I wonder what she’ll say about this journal? It’s
a treasure in itself. It really belongs to you, Bee.
You found it.”</p>

<p>“Yes; but in your room,” reminded Beatrice.</p>

<p>Nevertheless she looked rather wistfully at the
little sheepskin-covered book. It was indeed a
treasure worth having.</p>

<p>“I’ll offer it to Auntie, Bee,” Patsy replied,
noting the wistful look in Bee’s eyes. “We ought
to consider her first. If she doesn’t care for it,
it’s yours.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, <em>you</em> keep it,” protested Bee. “I
couldn’t accept it, really.”</p>

<p>“We’ll settle that later. Oh, I forgot! We
haven’t looked at the folded paper yet that fell
out of the book.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p>

<p>Patsy turned to the table and picked up the
forgotten paper.</p>

<p>“It’s a letter,” she informed. Then her face
clouded. “It’s written in Spanish,” she added
disgustedly. “You can read it, Mab, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“Patsy, <i lang="es">querida</i>, give me the letter,” eagerly
begged Dolores, who as usual had played the
silent but always avidly interested listener. “I
would read it for you.”</p>

<p>“Why, that’s so! I forgot all about your being
Spanish, Dolores,” smiled Patsy.</p>

<p>“Let Dolores read it,” urged Mabel. “She can
make a much better translation of it than I.”</p>

<p>“Go ahead, Dolores,” Patsy handed her the
letter. Eleanor and Bee also echoed the request.</p>

<p>Shyly delighted at being thus importuned by
the girls she so greatly loved and admired, Dolores
took the letter and scanned it with knitted
brows:</p>

<p>“‘<i lang="es">Mi querido hijo</i>,’” she read aloud. “That
means, ‘My dear son.’ I will not read more of
this in the Spanish, but try to tell you of it in
the English as I read it in my own language.
This it says:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“‘It is long since I have written to you. I
have waited for you to come to me, but you have
not come. I grow old and but last month I received<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
the wound in the side from an accursed
English captain whose ship we set upon and captured.
But he paid dearly for this outrage to
my person. We put him and all on board to the
torture.</p>

<p>“‘But my wound heals not and promises yet
to prove my death. Therefore I charge you to
continue to search for the treasure which the
accursed English brought ashore and buried on
the morning when my galleon fought them and
caused their destruction. You know well how
we hunted down those who concealed the treasure
and put them to torture. Stubborn pigs that
they were, they perished, unconfessed.</p>

<p>“‘Since that time I have searched long and frequently
for this box which I doubt not to be filled
with gold. I have wasted many hours over the
stupid book, but understand not at all. Neither
dare I give it to any who have knowledge of
English lest the secret hiding place of the treasure
thus become known to him who reads.</p>

<p>“‘Therefore I charge you to come to me soon
in order that I may deliver this book into your
hands with such instructions as I have for you.
For I am unable to come to you. When I shall
have passed out of this life and into the eternal
darkness, as I must surely do, since I have no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
belief in life after death, cease not to search for
the treasure. From His Majesty I have received
full title to the portion of land we marked off for
our own. Thus it becomes yours when I have
finished with it. Delay not, but come speedily

<p class="right">“‘<span class="smcap">Don Camillo de Fereda.</span>’”</p>

</div>

<p>“It’s the one thing we needed to complete our
case.”</p>

<p>It was Bee who shattered the hush that had
fallen upon the group.</p>

<p>“Yes. We know now that Don Camillo de
Fereda <em>was</em> really a pirate. That he commanded
the galleon that finished the <i>Dragon</i>. We know
what happened to Sir John Holden and his men
and how the book came into the possession of the
Feredas,” enumerated Patsy. “The letter and
the book have been handed down from generation
to generation because none of the Feredas ever
found the treasure of Las Golondrinas.”</p>

<p>“That was because of the wickedness of Don
Camillo de Fereda,” asserted Dolores. “It was
not intended that either he or any of this family
should find. Because of it old Manuel died bitter
and without faith. To Rosita it brought the
madness. I believe that it has the curse laid
upon it.”</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXVI">CHAPTER XXVI<br />
<span class="smaller">“THE TRUE SIGN OF THE ‘DRAGON’”</span></h2>

<p>The story of the treasure of Las Golondrinas
was not to be thus easily dismissed
from the minds of the Wayfarers.
Quite the contrary, it became paramount as a
topic of conversation. The journal of the unfortunate
Englishman, Sir John Holden, and the
letter written by Don Camillo de Fereda were
duly exhibited to and read by Miss Martha and
Mr. Carroll.</p>

<p>Though both were considerably impressed by
the girls’ find neither was in sympathy with
Patsy’s half-jesting, half-earnest assertion: “It
would be fun to poke around in the woods a little
and hunt for the treasure, if we had the least
bit of an idea what ‘the sign of the <i>Dragon</i>’ was.”</p>

<p>Miss Carroll had promptly vetoed the “poking
around in the woods” plan, appealing to Mr.
Carroll to support her in prohibiting such a proceeding.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
He had been equally ready on his own
account, however, to decry Patsy’s proposal.</p>

<p>“Don’t allow this treasure story to take hold
on your minds,” he had discouraged. “It’s highly
interesting, of course, but that’s all. You’re not
apt to discover a treasure that generations of
Feredas failed to locate. They knew the ground
thoroughly and failed. You know nothing of
that jungle behind the beach.”</p>

<p>With no one save Bee as an ally, Patsy’s ambition
saw no prospect of realization. Still the
treasure story remained uppermost in her mind.
It haunted her, particularly during the morning
excursions to and from the bathing beach. The
portion of jungle through which the white, sandy
beach-road ran became invested with new interest.
Its green depths concealed a treasure, once
the treasure of the Dragon, now the treasure of
Las Golondrinas.</p>

<p>“Do you suppose this part of the coast has
changed very much since 1618?” Patsy reflectively
questioned one morning, as she and Bee
lay on the warm sands sunning themselves after
a long swim.</p>

<p>“I don’t know.” Bee was gazing absently seaward.
“You’re thinking about the treasure, of
course,” she added with a smile.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes,” Patsy admitted. “Too bad Sir John
wasn’t captain of the <i>Dragon</i>. He’d have kept
a log instead of a journal, and in it he would have
set down the ship’s exact position. How far it
was from shore, I mean, and all that.”</p>

<p>“I have an idea that the <i>Dragon</i> anchored quite
a way below this part of the beach,” declared
Beatrice, “and not so very far from land. It’s
just as Sir John said, the beach along here curves
a little like a new moon. The upper end of the
curve runs farther out into the water than the
lower end. Above the upper end is the little bay
where the galleons must have anchored in the
night. You know how deep the water is there.
If the <i>Dragon</i> had been directly opposite this
curve, those on board would have probably
sighted the galleons and the captain would have
tried to get away when the first one attacked him.
They’d been fixing up the ship all that day, you
know.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s so,” nodded Patsy. “But where
do you think the men landed who went ashore in
the row-boat?”</p>

<p>“That’s hard to guess,” returned Bee. “If the
ship were anchored down there, they might have
rowed in a straight line to land without being
seen by the Spaniards. If the beach was then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
just as it is now, right along here would have
been a better place for them to land than down
there. Maybe the Spaniards had a lookout
posted in the woods watching them.”</p>

<p>“If they had, it’s funny that Don Camillo
didn’t send some of his men to follow them right
then, instead of waiting until after the attack,”
argued Patsy.</p>

<p>“I suppose he thought he had those poor Englishmen
just where he wanted them,” replied Bee.
“He knew that they couldn’t escape him. He
thought, perhaps, that it would be easy to make
them confess where they’d buried the box. You
know history says that the Spanish adventurers
who first came over here made a practice of torturing
the Indians to find out where they kept
their gold. Sir John and his men knew they’d be
killed by Don Camillo even if they confessed, so
they preferred to die by torture rather than tell
the secret.”</p>

<p>“It’s horrible to think of, isn’t it?” shuddered
Patsy. “I’m glad we were born three hundred
years later than those dangerous times. No one’s
life was safe then. Say, Bee,” Patsy sat up with
sudden energy. “I’m going to ask Auntie if we
can’t walk a little way down the beach this morning.
If she says ‘yes’ we’ll change our bathing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
suits and ask Dolores to go with us. I’m anxious
to see how it looks down there at that lower end
of the curve. Come on.”</p>

<p>Springing to her feet, Patsy raced across the
sands to where her aunt and Dolores were quietly
sitting, each absorbed in a book. Dolores’ fondness
for Nature did not include any desire whatever
for a close acquaintance with the ocean. No
amount of persuasion on the part of the Wayfarers
could induce her to go bathing with
them.</p>

<p>“Auntie, dear,” began Patsy in coaxing tones,
as she and Bee came to a pause before the two
on the sands, “do you care if we change our bathing
suits and go for a little walk down the beach?
We want you to go with us, Dolores. We won’t
go far, Aunt Martha, and will be back in just a
little while.”</p>

<p>“Very well.” Miss Carroll looked up placidly
from her reading. “I trust you, Dolores, to keep
these two reckless girls out of mischief,” she
added, turning to her companion.</p>

<p>Dolores laid her book aside and rose in instant
acquiescence to Patsy’s plea.</p>

<p>“Surely, I will go with you, Patsy, <i lang="es">querida</i>,”
she said in her soft voice. “Have no fear, Señora
Martha, that I shall not keep the very stern eyes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
upon these two,” she mischievously assured Miss
Carroll.</p>

<p>“Wait a minute till I see if Mab and Nellie
want to go,” Patsy said. Running down to the
water’s edge, she called out her invitation to the
Perry girls, who were industriously practising a
new swimming stroke which Mr. Carroll had
taught them on the previous day.</p>

<p>“No, we don’t want to go,” declined Mabel.
“We’re just beginning to get this stroke down
fine. Go away, Patsy Carroll.”</p>

<p>“Come along, Bee. The Perry children don’t
appreciate us,” Patsy commented satirically.</p>

<p>A little later, Bee and Patsy emerged from the
bath house, ready for their walk. Accompanied
by Dolores the trio started off down the beach.</p>

<p>“We’ve been quite a little way up the beach,
Dolores, but we’ve never gone a dozen yards
down it,” remarked Patsy, as they strolled along
in the sunshine. “We’re going as far as that
point down there and maybe farther. We want
to see how it looks on the other side of it. We
were talking about the <i>Dragon</i> this morning
and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I beg of you, Patsy, <i lang="es">querida</i>, think no more of
that horrible treasure.” Dolores had stopped
short, her dark eyes full of distress. “It is forbidden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
by the <i lang="es">señora</i> that you should walk in the
jungle. I have given the promise to keep the
care of you. So must I&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Come along, goosie, dear.” Patsy laid gentle
hold on Dolores’ arm. “We’re not going into the
jungle to hunt for the stupid old treasure. We
just want to go a little way and see things. Bee
and I have an idea that the men from the <i>Dragon</i>
might have touched shore on the other side of the
point when they rowed to land. We only want
to see how it looks there.”</p>

<p>“It is not so different from this,” Dolores declared,
“except that beyond the point is the small
inlet.”</p>

<p>“Is that so?” Bee remarked in surprise. “I
supposed that beyond the point was only a little
bay. The beach is narrow at the point on account
of the woods coming down so close to the
water. That’s the way it is with the upper end
of the curve, you know. Can we walk around the
point and along the shore of the inlet for a little
way without actually getting into the jungle?”</p>

<p>“<i lang="es">Si</i>,” returned Dolores, “but not very far.”</p>

<p>“Then let’s go as far as we dare,” proposed intrepid
Patsy. “You lead the way, Dolores.”</p>

<p>Presently arriving at the place where the beach
itself was merely a strip of sand extending out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
into the water, the three girls rounded the point
and walked along the sandy shore of the inlet.</p>

<p>They had gone only a few steps when Bee
stopped short and pointed out to sea.</p>

<p>“The <i>Dragon</i> might have been anchored right
over there, Patsy,” she asserted. “This would
have been a splendid place for the men in the row-boat
to land.”</p>

<p>“Maybe they did land here, and struck off into
the jungle, right there, where the inlet begins,”
surmised Patsy. “Let’s follow the shore of the
inlet. It’s almost as wide as this bit of beach and
doesn’t look snaky. As long as we don’t get into
the jungly part of the jungle we’re safe enough.”</p>

<p>“I think it will be all right for us to go up it a
few rods if we stick to the shore,” decided Bee.
“It looks so pretty up there under those trees
that hang over the water. Truly, Dolores, we’re
not thinking about the treasure now. It certainly
wasn’t buried along the shore of the inlet. Why,
the journal never mentioned an inlet. You go
ahead and we’ll follow. You know the ground.”</p>

<p>Reassured by Bee’s words, Dolores first hunted
about for a good-sized snake stick, then reluctantly
took the lead. The trio soon reached the
mouth of the inlet and continued up one side of
it for a short distance. The farther they went the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
narrower grew the sandy shore, lying even with
the jungle itself. Over the inlet hung a kind of
white haze, appearing to rise from the water.</p>

<p>“We’re in the jungle and yet not in it,” cheerfully
commented Patsy. “How misty that water
looks.”</p>

<p>She had hardly spoken when Bee uttered a
sharp exclamatory “Oh!”</p>

<p>Walking ahead, Dolores had come upon a
noisy puff adder curled up on the shore. While
it puffed its resentment at being disturbed, she
deftly caught it up on the end of the stick and
tossed it, hissing, into the water.</p>

<p>“It is not harmful,” she explained, “yet I have
the sorrow to see it, because it is the snake, and all
snakes are the sign of evil. Now we should perhaps
turn back. You have seen&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Her low, musical voice suddenly trailed off
into a horrified gasp. Simultaneously three pairs
of eyes had glimpsed a terrifying something rising
up through the mist from the inlet’s quiet
waters. As it continued to rise they caught a
fleeting impression of a grotesque, flat, wrinkled
head, composed chiefly of a heavy upper lip from
which depended a long trail of green. In its
flipper-like arms the ugly monster held a grayish
object, clasped close to its vast, shapeless body.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span></p>

<p>“It is an evil thing!” shrieked Dolores. Panic-stricken,
she reverted to her old wood nymph
tactics and bolted straight into the jungle, Patsy
and Beatrice following wildly after.</p>

<p>“Dolores!” at last screamed Bee in desperation.
“Wait for us!”</p>

<p>The shrill appeal checked the badly scared
wood nymph’s headlong flight long enough for
Bee and Patsy to come up with her. Breathless
though she was, Bee’s brief terror had apparently
taken wing. She was now smiling broadly.</p>

<p>“We’re a set of geese!” she exclaimed. “Do
you know what our horrible monster is? I do.
It’s nothing but a meek, harmless manatee!”</p>

<p>“What, then, is a manatee?” inquired Dolores,
in tones that indicated doubt that so terrible a
monster as she had just seen could possibly be
harmless.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s an animal something like a seal, only
a lot larger, that lives in the sea. It eats nothing
but plants and grass and is as harmless as a
kitten. I’ve seen pictures of manatees, but never
saw a real one before,” explained Bee. “The
minute after we started to run, I guessed what
it was we’d seen. They live in lagoons and the
mouths of rivers that run into the sea and inlets
like this. The poor thing was holding up its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
baby manatee for us to see and we never stopped
to admire it!”</p>

<p>“Let’s go back and look at it,” said Patsy.
“We’ve got to get out of this jungle as soon as
ever we can. We’ll have to go back the way we
came, I suppose. Auntie will be awfully cross
with me for this. She’ll blame me for the whole
business.”</p>

<p>“From here it is not so far to the jungle road,”
informed Dolores. “I know the little path to it.
That will be best for us to take, I believe.”</p>

<p>“All right,” acquiesced Bee, “only do let’s stop
and rest a little first. That wild run of ours
took most of my breath. There’s a nice, clean
place under that big tree. A five-minutes’ stop
there won’t do us any harm.”</p>

<p>Pausing only to break off a leafy branch from
a stunted sapling, Bee walked over to the spot
she had designated and energetically swept it, a
precautionary measure against lurking wood-ticks
and scorpions. Then she dropped down on
the dry ground with a little sigh of relief.</p>

<p>Dolores seated herself beside Bee. Patsy,
however, made no move to sit down. Instead,
she stopped half way to the tree and gazed about
her with alert, interested eyes.</p>

<p>“Look at that dandy big rock!” she exclaimed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
pointing to a huge boulder a little to the left of
where she was standing. “I can climb up on it
as easy as anything. It will be a fine perch. No
snakes or scorpions or horrid old wood-ticks can
get me up there.”</p>

<p>The rock on which Patsy proposed to perch
was perhaps five feet high and correspondingly
thick through. It measured at least eight feet
across. One end of it tapered down to a blunt
point, thereby furnishing Patsy an easy means
of reaching its rather flat top.</p>

<p>“Hurray!” was her jubilant exclamation when
a moment later she stood on top of the boulder
and waved a triumphant hand to her companions.
“The world is mine!”</p>

<p>Patsy made an elaborate bow, first to the right,
then to the left. Her eyes coming to rest on the
pointed end of the boulder she called out:</p>

<p>“What does this end of the rock make you
think of?”</p>

<p>“It reminds me of a rock,” jibed Bee. “I
can’t see that it looks like anything else.”</p>

<p>“That’s because you’re not up here,” retorted
Patsy. “Standing on the top, looking down, this
end is like an alligator’s head. No it isn’t, either.
It’s more like the head of a queer, prehistoric
monster. Why, girls!” Patsy’s voice suddenly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
rose to an excited squeal. “Come up here, quick!
I want to <em>show</em> you something!”</p>

<p>Quite in the dark regarding the cause of Patsy’s
agitation, Bee and Dolores lost no time, however,
in scrambling up on the boulder.</p>

<p>“Look!” Patsy pointed a shaking finger
downward. “Can’t you see it? Don’t you know
what it’s like?”</p>

<p>“It does look a little like one of those prehistoric
monster’s heads,” agreed Bee.</p>

<p>“It looks like more than that. It looks like a
<em>dragon’s</em> head. Now I know what Sir John
Holden meant when he wrote, ‘And we buried
the treasure at the true sign of the Dragon, which
was also His Majesty’s ship sunk this day.’ He
and his men came here with the box and found
this rock. He must have climbed to the top of
it to take an observation. He must have seen
the queer resemblance of this end of the rock to
a dragon’s head. He thought it would be a good
thing to bury the box near it, because then they
couldn’t mistake the place if they came back
again. I truly believe that somewhere in the
ground around this rock and close to it is the
treasure of Las Golondrinas!”</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXVII">CHAPTER XXVII<br />
<span class="smaller">THE TREASURE OF LAS GOLONDRINAS</span></h2>

<p>Two mornings after Patsy’s amazing discovery
of what she believed to be the
place where Sir John Holden had buried
the treasure box, an interested but not entirely
credulous delegation set out for the jungle.</p>

<p>It consisted of the Wayfarers, Dolores, Mr.
and Miss Carroll, Uncle Jemmy and two negro
laborers. These last were laden with picks and
shovels. It had taken lengthy and insistent
pleading on Patsy’s part to bring about this
much-desired state of affairs.</p>

<p>Despite the fact that she had been soundly
taken to task by her aunt and her father for disobedience
of orders, her reiterated plea was:
“You may scold me as much as you like, Dad, if
only you’ll send somebody to dig up the earth
around Dragon Rock.” Thus Patsy had named
the big boulder. She was firmly convinced that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
her theory concerning the location of the treasure
would prove correct, if investigated thoroughly.</p>

<p>Demurring at first, the fascination of treasure
hunting had finally laid sufficient hold on Mr.
Carroll to the point of consenting to humor Patsy’s
belief. Hence the party that, guided by Dolores,
was now on its way to Dragon Rock.</p>

<p>To the Wayfarers it was the great hour of their
young lives. They regarded the expedition as
the very height of adventure. Miss Martha was
also rather stirred up over it, though she maintained
her usual lofty attitude of pretending she
was not. Dolores was solemnly superstitious lest
evil might overtake the whole party. Mr. Carroll
was frankly sceptical. As for the darkies, they
had no inkling of what it was all about. Neither
were they in the least concerned. Sufficient that
Massa Carroll “wanted dem woods dug up.”</p>

<p>Finally arrived at Dragon Rock, Patsy constituted
herself master of ceremonies, gravely escorting
her father to the top of the boulder to
show him the dragon’s head. Mabel and Eleanor
also clambered up to see and were duly impressed.
Miss Martha, however, had too much
dignity for rock climbing.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 460px;">
<img src="images/illus4.jpg" width="460" height="650" alt="" />
<p class="caption">“Look!” Patsy pointed a shaking
finger downward. “Can’t you see it?”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, Patsy, I guess the boys might as well
start digging,” was Mr. Carroll’s opinion after
a brief inspection of the ground around the boulder.
“Better stand well back, all of you. I’m
going to have a circular ditch dug around the
rock, say about four feet wide and four deep. If
there is really a box buried there, it is probably
buried close to the rock. That’s the theory I’m
going to proceed on.”</p>

<p>With this, Mr. Carroll left her and went over
to where Uncle Jemmy and his two assistants
stood leaning on their picks, indolently awaiting
his orders. Instructing them as to the width and
depth of the ditch he purposed they should dig,
he set them to work and stood watching them for
a moment, a half-amused smile on his face.</p>

<p>“We never thought we’d ever go treasure-hunting,
did we, Martha?” he remarked as he
joined the interested group of spectators, drawn
up a little to the left of the rock. “It takes me
back to the days when we were youngsters and
read dozens of treasure stories and wondered if
we should ever be lucky enough to stumble upon
a real treasure.”</p>

<p>“Judging from appearances, I should say our
ideas haven’t changed much,” dryly returned his
sister. “We are as deep in the mud as Patsy is
in the mire.”</p>

<p>“What are you going to do with this great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
treasure, when we find it, Patsy?” humorously
questioned her father.</p>

<p>“Give half of it to Dolores, and then we’ll divide
the other half among us,” returned Patsy.</p>

<p>This immediately evoked a chorus of laughing
approval on the part of everyone save Dolores,
who protested stoutly against any such division.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the three darkies had proceeded
stolidly with their task. The loose sandy soil
made digging comparatively easy and before long
a shallow ditch circled the rock. As they continued
to work at deepening it, conversation among
the watchers died out and a curious hush fell upon
the group, broken only by the forest sounds
around them and the dull grating of pick and
shovel coming in contact with the sand.</p>

<p>Patsy, however, could not resist going over to
the ditch from time to time for a close-up view
of it. She was beginning to feel a keen sense of
disappointment. It looked as though her wonderful
treasure theory was about to tumble down.</p>

<p>“I guess I was away off on my sign of the
Dragon,” she ruefully admitted, as she returned
to her friends after a gloomy inspection of the
sandy ditch. “Where Uncle Jemmy’s digging,
he’s got down at least three feet and there’s not
a sign of&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span></p>

<p>Patsy did not finish. A sudden hail from
Uncle Jemmy of: “Ah reckon, Massa Carroll,
dey am suthin’ heah ’sides dirt!” caused her to
dash back to the ditch. Immediately the others
hurried after her to the spot.</p>

<p>Standing in the ditch the old man was tapping
lightly with his shovel on a partially uncovered
oblong of wood that appeared to form the top
of a box or casket. As nearly as could be seen it
was about three feet long and eighteen inches
wide.</p>

<p>“Oh, Uncle Jemmy, do please hurry and dig it
out!” implored Patsy, almost tumbling into the
ditch in her excitement. “It’s the treasure box!
It truly is! I was right after all about the sign
of the Dragon!”</p>

<p>“Move back, girls,” ordered Mr. Carroll.
“Give Jemmy room to get at the thing. This
certainly dashes me.”</p>

<p>Amid a babble of excited comment, the party
moved back from the opening, breathlessly
watching Uncle Jemmy as he loosened the earth
around the box. It was so tightly packed as to
suggest the labor of purposeful hands. It needed
but a little more effort on the part of the old man
to reveal what was undoubtedly a seaman’s chest,
belonging to a remote period.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span></p>

<p>Next instant Mr. Carroll had stepped into the
ditch beside the old man and was bending over
the old chest. Above, a circle of eager faces
peered down at him. The other two darkies had
also dropped shovels and rushed to the scene,
mouths agape with curiosity, eyes wildly rolling.</p>

<p>Grasping one end of the chest with both hands,
Mr. Carroll received a surprise. The lid of the
chest moved under his hands. A concerted murmur
came from above as he lifted it free. Then
the murmur welled to a united shout. What the
watchers had expected to see, none of them had
been prepared to state. What they really saw
was something entirely different from any idea
each might have formed of the lost treasure of
Las Golondrinas.</p>

<p>Following the shout that had ascended, came
an instant of silence. It was Patsy who first
spoke.</p>

<p>“Lift the box out of there, Dad,” she said in
a rather unsteady tone. “Let us have it up where
we can get a good look at the wonderful treasure.”</p>

<p>Suddenly she burst into a peal of high, clear
laughter which went the rounds of the amazed
treasure-seekers. Amid almost hysterical mirth
the chest was raised from its resting place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span></p>

<p>“It’s ready to fall to pieces,” commented Mr.
Carroll, as he carefully set the box on the ground.
“It’s made of good tough wood or it wouldn’t
have held together all these years. Well, Patsy,
what do you think of your treasure now?”</p>

<p>“Not much, except that Sir John Holden
never put that stuff in there. It tells its own
story, though.”</p>

<p>Kneeling beside the chest she reached into it
and fished up a rudely fashioned tomahawk, the
blade of which was merely a sharp stone.</p>

<p>“This, and this,” she again reached down and
added a long, wicked-looking arrow-head to the
tomahawk, “tell me that the people who really
found the treasure were the Indians. Don’t you
remember that Sir John wrote in the journal
that he didn’t doubt that there were Indians lurking
about in this jungle? They were watching
when Sir John and his men buried the treasure.
After they’d gone, the Indians came here and
dug it up.”</p>

<p>“It seems queer that they didn’t just throw
the chest away instead of burying it again with
those queer weapons in it,” declared Mabel.</p>

<p>The Wayfarers were now down on their knees
in a little circle about the chest, interestedly lifting
and inspecting the few articles it still contained.
There was another tomahawk, a murderous-looking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
mace and a number of stone
arrow-heads of various sizes. This, then, was the
treasure of Las Golondrinas. For it, one Fereda
had taken many lives, and because of it, his descendants
had wasted long years of bitter, unavailing
search.</p>

<p>“It strikes me that the Indians of three hundred
years ago liked to play jokes,” was Mr. Carroll’s
opinion. “That seems to be about the only
explanation of this stuff being here in the box.
They took the treasure and decided to leave a
grim message for the other fellows if they ever
came back for their valuables. It was their way
of saying ‘Stung!’ I guess.”</p>

<p>“We’ve all been <em>stung</em>,” giggled Patsy.</p>

<p>“Too bad it wasn’t that wicked old Camillo
instead of nice harmless people like us,” said Bee.</p>

<p>“And we were going to give Dolores half of
it,” mourned Patsy. “Now we’ve nothing to give
her except a war-club and a couple of old tomahawks
which she certainly won’t have any use for.”</p>

<p>This raised a laugh in which even Dolores
joined. She had looked unduly solemn since the
beginning of the expedition. Now for the first
time her sober face lighted into its wonderful
radiant beauty.</p>

<p>“For this I am glad,” she declared earnestly.
“To find in this box gold and jewels would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
been the sorrow, because such treasure cost some
lives. So it was surely evil. Now we know all
and thus Las Golondrinas which was always the
unlucky place becomes the lucky. So shall good
fortune stay here now, for always.</p>

<p>“I have read in the books the stories of the
princesses who, because they were good and
lovely, broke the wicked spells of the bad ones.
So is <i lang="es">querida</i> Patsy, the dear princess, who because
she would not give up seeking the treasure,
broke the spell and made all good again here.
There is now no more of mystery, so there will
be no more of the unhappiness. <i lang="es">Querida</i> princess,
I kiss your hand.”</p>

<p>Carried away by her own fanciful comparisons,
Dolores caught Patsy’s hand and kissed it.</p>

<p>“You’re the sweetest old dear alive.” Patsy
wound her arms about Dolores. “Since you will
have it that I am a princess, I’ll add a little more
to the tale. Princess Patsy freed a wood nymph
from a wicked witch. Then the wood nymph was
so grateful to the princess that she promised
never to go away from her. She said, ‘I will go
to the far North with you and the Señora Martha
and the Señor Carroll and live in your house and
become your very own sister.’ Isn’t that what
she said, Dolores?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span></p>

<p>A flood of color rushed to Dolores’ cheeks.
Her great dark eyes grew misty. For a moment
she stood silent, fighting for self-control.
Then she raised her eyes timidly to Miss Martha’s
dignified countenance. It was a smiling
face now and very tender. Next her glance
wandered to Mr. Carroll as though in question.
What she saw in his face was also reassuring.</p>

<p>“Isn’t that what she said, Dolores?” repeated
Patsy encouragingly.</p>

<p>“<i lang="es">Si</i>,” was the soft answer.</p>

<p>And thus the future of Dolores the wood
nymph was settled, thereby proving that for her
at least the era of good fortune had begun.</p>

<p>“Dad,” began Patsy that evening at dinner,
“when are we going on that expedition into the
Everglades? We’ve only two more weeks’ vacation,
you know.”</p>

<p>“We can go next week, if you like,” amiably
responded her father.</p>

<p>“I was in hopes you had forgotten all about
that, Patsy,” complained her aunt. “Haven’t
you had enough excitement? Why not settle
down quietly for the rest of the time we are to be
here? I can’t say I enjoy the prospect of such
a jaunt.”</p>

<p>“Why, Auntie!” Patsy stared across the table<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
at Miss Martha in beaming amazement. “Are
<em>you</em> really going with us? I thought you
said&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“So I did,” cut off her aunt, “but I have
changed my mind. I’ve discovered that I can
walk around in a jungle as well as the rest of
you. In fact, I prefer it to staying alone in this
house. I shall never feel easy until that hobgoblin
collection of portraits is cleared out of the
gallery and the whole place renovated.”</p>

<p>“That reminds me, Eulalie never answered our
letter,” commented Beatrice.</p>

<p>“Well, we don’t care now. We solved all the
mysteries of Las Golondrinas for ourselves,” asserted
Patsy. “We know all about the painted
cavalier, we captured the ghost, found a secret
door, a secret drawer and the treasure of Las
Golondrinas. We’ve got the journal of Sir John
Holden. It’s a perfect jewel in itself, and I’ve
found a foster-sister. Can you beat it?”</p>

<p>She cast a roguish glance at her aunt as she
perpetrated this slangy offense.</p>

<p>“Our vacation’s almost over, but we’ve another
one coming next summer,” she continued.
“We’re five Wayfarers now, and we’ll wayfare
into strange lands and find new and curious
things. The Wayfarers can’t be like other people,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
you know. They just have to do startling
things and live in startling places. They’ve
proved that twice&mdash;and oh, joy! Summer’s coming.
When it does come and the Wayfarers take
the road again, who knows what wonderful things
may happen to them?”</p>

<p>How the Wayfarers spent the summer vacation,
to which Patsy was already looking forward
with eager zest, will be told in the third volume
of this series entitled, “<span class="smcap">Patsy Carroll in the
Golden West</span>.”</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
